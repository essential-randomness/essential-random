It was originally published in\nJuly 2023, and I'm only now (December 2023) getting to making it public. If you\nwant new editions of this Town Hall straight into your inbox as soon as they're\navailable, you can support me on\n[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/essentialrandomness),\n[Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/essentialrandomness) or [this same\nwebsite](/support-me)!\n\n</details>\n\n<details class=\"socials-callout\">\n<summary>Prefer to read (or share) on socials?</summary>\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EssentialRandom/status/1730008152652075403?s=20)\n- [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/essential-randomness/735367619946987521/ms-bobas-quarterly-extravaganza-1-intro?source=share)\n- [Fediverse](https://indiepocalypse.social/@essentialrandom/111496528300906386)\n- [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social/post/3kfegvmpx7g2b)\n\n</details>\n\n<details class=\"warning\" open>\n  <summary>Warning: Missing Feature!</summary>\n  **You cannot enlarge images on this blog yet** (alas). Do make generous use of\n  \"open image in new tab\" on browsers, \"pan to zoom\" on mobile, or ignore the small\n  text and focus on the–literal!–big picture.\n</details>\n## Intro: This \"Town Hall\"\n\nFashionably late (or, better said, just in time for the second one), it's time\nto finally release my first $upporters-only Town Hall to the world, \"...and Now\nIt's Time to Find Out\" edition!\n\nFollow along this blog post to learn more about the BobaVerse (including what it\nis)... but first, some context!\n\n![file:./slide-1.alt.txt](./slide-1.png)\n\n### About \"Town Halls\"\n\nFor the uninitiated to the intricacies of \"corp speak\" a Town Hall is a meeting\nwhere leaders answer questions and share plans with everyone. My own flavor of\nTown Halls (\"Quarterly Extravaganzas\") are sent ~quarterly to my paid $upporters\n([you can become one\nhere](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/support-me#donate)).\n\n![file:./slide-2.alt.txt](./slide-2.png)\n\n### Ground Rules\n\nBefore we dive in, something incredibly important to me (and hopefully to you\ntoo): ground rules. While some don't apply at the public stage, others (like the\n\"trade offer\") remain relevant. I strive to be open, honest, and accountable,\nbut I can only be in a mutually-respectful and psychologically safe environment!\n\n![file:./slide-3.alt.txt](./slide-3.png)\n\n### Getting Started (Finally)\n\nWith this out of the way, then welcome to the first public edition of \"Ms Boba's\nQuarterly Extravaganza\", aptly named \"and Now It's Time to Find Out\".\n\n![file:./slide-4.alt.txt](./slide-4.png)\n\n## Part 1: What is The BobaVerse™?\n\n![file:./slide-5.alt.txt](./slide-5.png)\n\n### The BobaVerse™\n\nAs the slides say, \"the BobaVerse™ is an eclectic collection of projects related\nto coding, community and fandom on the web that may or may not create a\nsustainable ecosystem one day\". We took all we learned while [building up the\nBobaBoard project and community](/projects/bobaboard), and charter the path to a\nfuture where members of online niche communities participate in the creation of\nboth spaces and software!\n\n![file:./slide-6.alt.txt](./slide-6.png)\n![file:./slide-7.alt.txt](./slide-7.png)\n\n### Building it Slow\n\nGetting any project to sustainability is hard, but getting a project off the\nground in this online (and fandom) environment is a particularly thorny issue!\nDoing it slowly is fundamental to success, but doing it slowly is not easy,\neither! Many issues loom on the horizon.\n\n![file:./slide-8.alt.txt](./slide-8.png)\n![file:./slide-9.alt.txt](./slide-9.png)\n\n### A Different Approach\n\nGiven the complexities of building sustainable community-driven software, The\nBobaVerse™ wants to do things differently: rather than just building another\nunsustainable social platform with disenfranchised users, it seeks a\nself-sustaining ecosystem that involves them in the building process (and helps\nget more underrepresented people into Open Source at the same time)!\n\n![file:./slide-10.alt.txt](./slide-10.png)\n![file:./slide-11.alt.txt](./slide-11.png)\n\n## Part 2: Where is The BobaVerse™ at?\n\n(or better said, \"where was the BobaVerse at in July 2023, when this was\nwritten?\")\n\n![file:./slide-12.alt.txt](./slide-12.png)\n\n### The Fundamental Question\n\nWhile a vision like this poses a lot of questions, the most important one is\nalso simple: can this all be set up for success before I run out of money and\nhave to go back to sell my <abbr title=\"Over Powered\">OP</abbr>\nprogramming/marketing skills to some <abbr title=\"Venture\nCapital\">VC</abbr>-backed company?\n\n![file:./slide-13.alt.txt](./slide-13.png)\n\n### Learning, Failing, and Back to Learning\n\nThe process of getting to sustainably build things is a treacherous and complex\none, one that must account for the (unfortunately inevitable) failures along the\nway. Learning is a fundamental part of the building process!\n\nWe fail, we learn, we get up, we go back to trying!\n\n![file:./slide-14.alt.txt](./slide-14.png)\n![file:./slide-15.alt.txt](./slide-15.png)\n![file:./slide-16.alt.txt](./slide-16.png)\n\n### Our Wins\n\nIn more practical fashion, the first half of this year (back in July) saw quite\na few wins under our belt! The highlight is [The Fujoshi Guide to Web\nDevelopment](/projects/fujoguide), our successfully Kickstarted guide to Git and\nGitHub that will help us clear the highest hurdle to collaboration: teaching\nVersion Control to a whole new set of people!\n\n![file:./slide-17.alt.txt](./slide-17.png)\n\n### Our Losses\n\nWe also had a few Ls, which we don't shy away from! For one, the Kickstarter was\nan immense amount of effort (but worth it); I'm incredibly far from covering my\nrent (so I can keep at this); and life just Keep Happening™ to both me and\nvolunteers, which makes collaboration hard!\n\n![file:./slide-18.alt.txt](./slide-18.png)\n\n### How to Help\n\nSo how can you help? Well, we did have some requests, and we did get help with a\nbunch of them! Right now (for how uncomfortable that is to say) the main thing\nwe need is recurring income. Our runway is getting shorter, and every little bit\nhelps us focus on building and not fundraising!\n\n![file:./slide-19.alt.txt](./slide-19.png)\n\n**The most impactful way is to support me directly**, either on\n[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/essentialrandomness) or on [this same\nwebsite](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/support-me). If you can't give\nyourself, consider pitching it to friend(s) that want to help build a better\nweb!\n\n**If you'd rather give one time,** we're running a 2023 holidays fundraiser with\nexciting discounts! It won't give you early Town Hall access (unlike patron\nsupport), but you can get sleek Yaoi cheese paddles or Ship Ownership\ncertificates for you or a friend!\n\n<details class=\"socials-callout\" open>\n  <summary>Our Current Holidays Special</summary>\n\n![file:./holidaysimage.alt.txt](./holidaysimage.png)\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fujostore/status/1729309692831391861)\n- [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/fujostore/735192195765846016/the-official-bobaverse-holiday-fundraiser)\n- [Fediverse](https://blorbo.social/@fujostore/111485439389988613)\n- [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/fujostore.bsky.social/post/3kf7izzwce22b)\n\n</details>\n\n![file:./slide-20.alt.txt](./slide-20.png)\n\n## Bonus: What we Learned Running a Kickstarter Campaign\n\nSince content creation takes a long time (and I need to entice people somehow),\nI'm keeping bonus question content as subscribers-only!
