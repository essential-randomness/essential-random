In this series, I want\nto give an eagle-eye-view of this ecosystem, and how it works to accomplish its goal:\n**turn the web back into a place of fun, joy, and connection, where people build\nand nurture their own communities and software.**\n\n<figure>\n  ![file:./slide-7.alt.txt](./slide-7.png)\n  <figcaption>\n    Slide introducing the FujoVerse™, from [the first edition of my\n    quarterly(ish) newsletter](/posts/extravaganzas/1-now-its-time-to-find-out)\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<details class=\"socials-callout\">\n<summary>Want to read (or share) on socials?</summary>\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EssentialRandom/status/1744866727778021554?s=20)\n- [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/essential-randomness/739086784550649856/enter-the-bobafujoverse)\n- [Fediverse](https://indiepocalypse.social/@essentialrandom/111728810405139665)\n- [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/essentialrandom.bsky.social/post/3kill54sbvu2r)\n\n</details>\n\n## The Pillars: Community, Software Ownership, and Technical Education\n\n[The FujoVerse™ projects](/projects) evolved over time, based on what I learned\nbuilding each piece, making friends and allies, and reading anything I could\nfind on related topics. While ambituous goals that tackle complex systems\ncannot have too-tight roadmaps, these efforts have hovered around a few fundamental\npillars:\n\n### Community\n\nThere's many issues that come together to make the modern web feel like a \"joyless\nlandscape\", but **a core and often-underestimated problem is the abscence of\n_true communities_.** Indeed, while the hyper-connectedness of contemporary\nsocial online spaces may trick us into seeing these as such, their shape makes\nit hard (if not impossible) to build the necessary group identity, shared norms,\nand mutual concern between their members[^4].\n\nResearch shows that **the lack of true community heavily contributes to\nloneliness and social isolation we feel in the modern days**, even in the online\nworld. This adds to the disenfranchisement felt by many users, and keeps them\ndisempowered and stuck in a loop of helplessness and often-misdirected anger at one\nanother. (Re)building communities is required to change how we feel and\ninteract on the web.\n\n### Software Ownership and Collaboration\n\nThe needs of niche online communities are, well, _niche_. While software built\nby big tech companies is increasingly at odds even with mainstream users, the\ncurrent dynamics disproportionately impact marginalized groups and communities.\n**To build software that responds to their own needs, members of niche\ncommunities must be able to shape this software themselves.**\n\nAs we know, however, this challenge is not only technical[^5]: solving it means\nbuilding structures and processes for constructive collaboration, both within\neach community and accross different ones. Unfortunately, **effective\ncollaboration requires both trust and psychological safety.** As communities\nerode, and the web and social systems break down, building safe, stable spaces\nfor collaborative work (an already-difficult problem) becomes more and more\ncomplex.\n\n### Education (Technical and Beyond)\n\nTo shape their own spaces, members of niche online communities need to know how to\nbuild and maintain their own software. Unfortunately, most educational material\nfor web developers targets people who seek a professional career, or hardly\nmoves past simple HTML and CSS pages (with maybe a sprinke of basic\nJavaScript)[^6]. **To change the web, we need highly-technical education that\nspeaks the language of hobbyists**, supports and encourages their desire for\nmastery, and carries them across the gap from beginner to intermediate builders.\n\nOnce again, the need for education goes beyond the technical realm:\nfrom community building to conflict resolution, from negotiation to effective\n(and kind) communication, from marketing to business to project management, **niche\ncommunities need many different skills to build a better future for themselves\nand the web.** In a world that doesn't equip many of us with these skills, we\nmust build approachable and trusted resources to learn them from.\n\n> **Note:** In more than one way, these pillars also intersect with _open source software_\n> and _decentralized protocols_.\n\n## The Future: Help Build the FujoVerse™\n\nDespite all that we've already built, **The FujoVerse™ is still in its\ninception.** We have a long road ahead of us to support the collaborators that\nmake our project possible, and to continue making an impact in 2024 and beyond. To\nthis end, **this year I'm focused on building a larger public to find new\nsupporters and sponsors.** If you believe that a better web is worth fighting\nfor, you can support our work [on\nPatreon](https://www.patreon.com/essentialrandomness) or [by subscribing through my\nown alternative](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/support-me#donate). If you\nwish to donate more, you can [reach out to set up a custom\nsponsorship](mailto:essential.randomn3ss@gmail.com).\n\nIn the long term, given the opportunity and finances to do so, **we believe we\ncan build profitable projects that will be able to independently sustain our\nmission.** After all, the people who contribute to The FujoVerse™ have a unique\nperspective that speaks to the needs of the web and its netizens in a way that\nno mainstream company can replicate. While the road to manifesting and\nharnessing their power will be difficult, nothing ambitious has ever looked easy\nfrom the starting line.\n\n<figure>\n  ![file:./slide-10.alt.txt](./slide-10.png)\n  <figcaption>\n    Slide explaining the masterplan, from [the first edition of my\n    quarterly(ish) newsletter](/posts/extravaganzas/1-now-its-time-to-find-out)\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<div class=\"socials-callout\">\n<h3>Like what you read?

While my work centers around\n    [\"transformational/shipping\n    fandom\"](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Transformational_Fandom) (because that's\n    my own online niche), the projects, principles and lessons are applicable beyond it.\n\n[^4]:\n    This will be an article at some point. For now I suggest reading [The Art\n    of\n    Community](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-art-of-community-seven-principles-for-belonging-charles-vogl/12472751),\n    or (if you can stomach business speak) the excellent [Building Brand\n    Communities](https://bookshop.org/p/books/building-brand-communities-how-organizations-succeed-by-creating-belonging-carrie-melissa-jones/11208654),\n    from the same author.\n\n[^5]:\n    The challenge is not only technical, but it is (alas) _also technical_. A\n    baseline of technical skills and understanding empowers people in other\n    roles to become more active and informed partecipants. It's important that\n    we nurture these skills, just like we must nurture non-technical skills in\n    tech-oriented folks.\n\n[^6]:\n    Sometimes people push against this point by listing various existing\n    resources. However, after spending three years and counting mentoring\n    hobbyist coders and nurturing a community dedicated to their growth, I\n    continue being confident in this assessment.\n\n<style>{`\n    img {\n      padding-block: 0!important;\n      border: 1px solid #bbb;\n      box-shadow: 4px 4px 0 0px #ddd;\n      width: calc(100% - 8px);\n    }\n    img + img {\n      margin-top: 20px;\n    }\n    figure {\n        text-align: center;\n    }\n    figcaption {\n        margin-top: 5px;\n        text-size: small;\n        color: gray;\n    }\n    .whats-this, .socials-callout, .warning {\n      font-family: var(--font-family-title);\n      background-color: #f4f4f4;\n      padding: 20px;\n      margin-top: 40px;\n    }\n    .socials-callout h3 {\n      margin: 0 0 10px 0;\n      font-size: 20px;\n    }\n    .socials-callout img {\n      margin-block: 20px;\n      max-width: 600px;\n    }\n    .socials-callout ul {\n      margin: 0;\n      padding: 0 0 0 20px;\n    }\n    .socials-callout li {\n      margin: 0 0 0 0;\n    }\n    .socials-callout summary {\n      font-size: 16px;\n      cursor: pointer;\n    }\n    div.socials-callout:last-of-type {\n      margin-bottom: 50px;\n    }\n`}</style>\n";
