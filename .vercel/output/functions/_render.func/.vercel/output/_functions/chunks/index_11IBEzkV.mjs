						const body = "\n## What are Quarterly Extravaganzas?\n\n\"Quarterly Extravaganza\" is **my quarterly(ish) newsletter where I\nupdate my (paid) $upporters on everything that's going on with [my\nprojects](/projects).** Currently, extravaganzas are delivered as PowerPoint\npresentations, with a hefty dose of accompanying small-text commentary that\nreflects how my ADHD brain thinks about these topics.\n\n<figure>\n\n![](./quick-context.png)\n\n<figcaption>Tidy slides are the reflection of a tidy mind</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Are there Ground Rules to these Extravaganzas?\n\nI'm glad you asked! The goal of these extravaganzas is to create a space where\npeople who support my work can not only be kept up to date, but receive this\ninformation in a way that's authentic, transparent, and holds me accountable for\nthe choices I make. While this is important to me, however, **it's also\nimportant that people on the other side understand it as a mutual exhange.**\nIndeed, this relationship can only flourish in an environment where people\nrespect who I am, understand the difficult constraints I work under, and trust\nthat, while I _will_ make mistakes along the way, I'm deeply committed to my\nstated ideals.\n\n![](./ground-rules.png)\n\n## How do I get these Quarterly Extravaganzas?\n\nTo get them hot off the presses and straight to your inbox, you can become a\n$upporter on either [my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/essentialrandomness) or\n[this same website](/support-me#donate) (or even\n[Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/essentialrandomness/tiers)). Eventually, each\nExtravaganza will also make it to the larger public on this blog. For a sample,\n[you can read the first edition here](/posts/extravaganzas/1-now-its-time-to-find-out).\n\n<style>{`\n    img {\n      padding-block: 0!important;\n      border: 1px solid #eee;\n      box-shadow: 4px 4px 0 0px #f5f5f5;\n      width: calc(100% - 8px);\n    }\n    img + img {\n      margin-top: 20px;\n    }\n    figure {\n        text-align: center;\n    }\n    figcaption {\n        margin-top: 5px;\n        text-size: small;\n        color: gray;\n    }\n    body {\n        padding-bottom: 40px;\n    }\n`}</style>\n";
