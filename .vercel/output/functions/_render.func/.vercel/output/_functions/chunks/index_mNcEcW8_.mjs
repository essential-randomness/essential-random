note: I KNOW it looks like im subtweeting but istg i would have written this the

this is just the natural state human organizations trend towards, everything is
on a constant path towards rot

tbh 99.9% of people skilled enough to coordinate the work of large/complex
organizations don't do it in their spare time for free, they get paid a shit-ton
of money for it 

which is of course not an excuse to ignore problems, in a way it makes it even
more important not to sweep issues under the rug and figure out how to work
through them successfully, but STILL

we\u2019ve really grown into a much more cohesive unit since we\u2019ve started our sprint
& retrospective process

1. The BobaBoard coders volunteer team has had \u201Cour most productive sprint yet\u201D

our current sprint is aptly named \u201Cit\u2019s a marathon not a sprint sprint\u201D though

the goal is to NOT do heroics to launch quickly, but to find a process that will
help us successfully collaborate in the long run

2. We raised $18k+ to write educational material for Git & GitHub

idk if you\u2019ve heard\u2026.

3. Fandom Coders is a thriving resource for beginners and experienced coders
alike

the Personal Website Club is THRIVING

and also teaching me a lot about where people\u2019s difficulties are and what we
must do to smooth them out

4. More and more recurring collaborators

There's an arrow pointing to "recurring" that's labelled "friend-shaped \u{1F49C}" with
a purple heart to match Waluigi.`

the only way to never fail is to never push past your  current skills

(also every presentation needs at least one Luigi scattered around)

Ms Boba Fucks Around and finds out that promoting a kickstarter campaign is an
incredibly huge amount of work

(im so proud of what we have achieved, the team has worked incredibly hard and
we made something so ambitious happen with so little resources)

having an accessible guide to version control for fandom folks is going to make
a real difference, I promise

The FujoGuide Kickstarter sprint was more taxing than expected (but we learned a
lot)

Ms Boba\u2019s recurring income still very far from covering her rent

my (portion of the) rent is ~$2,000 a month, because Silicon Valley\u2122 

Still tons of uncertainty around available resources 

Life Just Happens So Much\u2122 to everyone around us

jokes aside, this is part of the challenge with a volunteers team that is most
often from disadvantaged backgrounds

shit might hit the fan at any moment and core people might become unavailable in
very unpredictable ways

the best way to plan around this is money, the second best way is a lot of
redundancy and ms boba-brand Miracles\u2122 (which also come at a cost)`
