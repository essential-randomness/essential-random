When I decided to add\nanother side-hustle to my neverending list, someone introduced me to the\ncautionary concept of an **\"Avoid-at-all-Cost list\"**. At the risk of sounding\nlike a #ProductivityAsALifestyle column—they love to feature [this particular\nstory](https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus)— here's how the advice was given:\n\n1.  List the top 25 goals you want to achieve in the future.\n2.  Of these, choose the top 5.\n3.  The remaining 20 goals are now **your worst enemies**—that is, _your\n    Avoid-at-all-Costs list_.\n\n“Worst enemies\" sounds like overblown rhetoric, but it does have an core of\ntruth: you _care a lot_ about these goals (or they wouldn't be on the initial\nlist), you _desperately want_ to work on them (or they wouldn't be on the\ninitial list), and you can _easily rationalize_ the time spent on them as \"being\nproductive\" (or they wouldn't be on the initial list). Because of all this,\n**entertaining these _not-my-top-priority-but-still-cool goals_ is the easiest\nway to end up with 20 half-finished projects** instead of 5 completed ones,\nmaking them—QED—_your worst enemies_\n\nNow, productivity-at-all-costs advice generallymakes me feel icky. But it's true\nthat adding a more personal newsletter on top of, well, _building a whole social\nplatform from scratch_, should be seen as a bit of a danger zone. But not to\nworry! If I'm doing this, it's because **I'm rationalizing creating this\nnewsletter as an extension and companion to the ~BobaBoard journey~**, with\nwell-defined goals and non-goals meant to silence (or at least snooze) the\ncharming lure of overachievement! Even further, I've added a new gimmick to the\n\"experimental part\" of this newsletter: **each edition won't take more than 8\nhours from start to finish.**\n\nYes, I'm serious. Yes, I'm setting a timer. If typos remain, it is because I\nliterally ran out of time to fix them.\n\n---\n\n### Personal Newsletter Goals\n\n- Reach and connect with BobaBoard's _(potentially-paying, heavily invested)_\n  public.\n- Put my business/development musings into semi-coherent writing, giving those\n  wiser than me the chance to expand on/poke holes in them.\n- Better understand long-form content creation, monetization, and\n  audience-building on the modern internet.\n- Prove myself as someone who—[Thomas the Tank Engine ahegao stickers aside\n  (NSFW)](https://store.bobaboard.com/#!/TTTE-Ahegao-Stickers/p/360242564/category=111819798)—makes\n  deliberate business and technical decisions, and is equipped to lead a serious\n  engineering and business effort.\n\n### Personal Newsletter Non-Goals\n\n- Consistent, on-time delivery.\n- Particularly good or witty writing.\n- Coherent voice or themes.\n- Being Unequivocally Right™.\n\n---\n\n## Doing Content Right\n\nThis edition originally featured **a discussion of [_\"heroic\nprogramming\"_](https://effectivesoftwaredesign.com/2016/10/20/when-software-development-depends-on-individual-heroic-efforts/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHeroic%20Programming%2C%20usually%20a%20pejorative,in%20order%20to%20complete%20it.)**,\none of the most underestimated traps in the way of successful software projects,\nand **a UX analysis of [Amino Apps](https://aminoapps.com)**, which peddles\n\"authentic mobile Communities for whatever you're into\" but largely fails at\nproviding actual value to BobaBoard's specific fandom audience. Instead, I've\ndecided to do a switcharoo and **talk about a book I've been reading, featuring\n\"everything \\[the author\\] knows about creating, writing, and scaling successful\nblogs and newsletters to millions of readers\" in the internet of 2021**: [Doing\nContent Right](https://doingcontentright.com/).\n\nIf those topics sounds interesting, don't worry: I literally don't have time to\nwaste on shelved content! In particular, **the Amino Apps analysis will be out\nfor paying-subscribers-only in the tentatively-near _(for some definitions of\nnear)_ future**.\n\nThis choice, like many I make, might seem puzzling, so let me introduce it with\na quote from the book:\n\n> \\[Y\\]ou may notice that a lot of the tactics in \\[this book\\] mirror\n> approaches that you would take to grow a startup. That is no coincidence.\n> **Successful blogs and newsletters serve to deliver value to people, resting\n> on the same mechanics that startups do.**\n\n_\"But Ms. Boba,\"_ you might say, not as excited as I am by this parallel, _\"why\nwould I want to hear about the mechanics behind building startups?\"_\n\nWell, dear reader, here's a few reasons:\n\n1.  **A solid grasp of how (online) products are built, marketed, and grown is\n    key to understanding the problems of the modern internet.** It's easy to\n    vaguely complain about \"commercialization\", but the real power comes with\n    lifting the veils on its core dynamics.\n2.  **Most entrepreneurship advice is given-by and geared-towards profit-driven,\n    status-seeking individuals.** This makes it harder to stomach for people\n    whose business ethics are incompatible with the current status quo—most\n    often members of marginalized groups or other minorities. Creating\n    accessible, ethical business advice is a fundamental part of changing who's\n    building succesful products on the internet.\n3.  **Many ethical/indie projects too hastily discard (or fail to seek)\n    \"classic\" entrepreneurial wisdom.** Even though the goals are often\n    different from mainstream products, indie projects are more likely to\n    succeed by _knowingly breaking the rules_ rather than ignoring them.\n    Building an ethical product without understanding the basis of\n    entrepreneurship is like thinking you only need to understand anatomy if\n    you're seeking to draw hyper realistic human figures.\n4.  **I'll most likely have to keep calling back to these concepts as I move\n    forward with this newsletter.** We might as well get them out of the way.\n\nTruth is, when I decided to build BobaBoard I immediately went to learn as much\nas I could about entrepreneurship, business, and marketing. While this entailed\nshutting up that part of my brain that went _\"ew, business stuff, ew, I am a\n100% certified free-range ethical engineer, I don't need to sell things!\"_, it's\nstill **the best choice I ever made for the project.** Even further: I found out\nthat, much to my own chagrin, a lot of this stuff _is_ surprisingly interesting,\nvaluable, and even, you might say, _enlightening_. After all, as mentioned\nabove, **these principles—especially their corruption—influence of our reality\non many different levels**, online and offline.\n\nSo, without further ado, here's the 3 most important steps in growing a\nstartup—or, according to the book, creating online content:\n\n1.  [Find Your Niche](#find-your-niche) (current newsletter)\n2.  Know Your Audience (next edition)\n3.  Solve a Problem (next edition)\n\n### Find Your Niche\n\nLet's start from the basics: what are _niches_? While we often think of them as\na synonym for a _small group_, that's not what \"niche\" means in marketing or\nbusiness. Instead, **niches are _highly specialized segments_ of the market**.\nIn particular, if _market_ is \"All The People Who Might One Day Buy Your\nStuff™\", _market niches_ are \"a subset of potential buyers with goals,\nlifestyle, and motivations uniform enough to make reasonable assumptions on\".\n\nAs an example, let's consider \"people who use the internet\" as our market. A\nniche could be _\"everyone who reads fanfictions\"_, but also _\"die-hard fans of\ncoffee-shop AUs\"_, _\"people who haven't touched anything rated M-or-below since\nthey left middle school\"_, or even _\"those who love a classic \"We Have Only One\nBedroom Left\" fic, but only if it takes place in a Marriott\"_. While there'll\nalways be some level of variance between individuals in these groups, the more\nwe tighten our niche, the more details about the people that make it up we can\nreasonably infer: for example, we can say that \"fanfiction readers\" will be more\nlikely to regularly use websites like AO3, WattPad, or fanfiction.net than the\ngeneral internet population; we can also imagine that, in addition to the\nprevious assumption, \"die-hard M-Raters\" are likely to resonate with the\npricinples behind sex positivity and have a stronger anti-censorship stance; or\neven, in \"the Mariott case\", we can imagine our very-specialized subgroup to be\nprimed for a high degree of brand loyalty.\n\nNiches, as you can see, exist at different levels of \"specialization\". The more\nspecialized the niche, the easier it will be to _specifically cater_ to it. This\nspecialization, of course, also directly correlates with the overall size of the\n_niche_. **But specialization doesn't necessarily imply that the resulting\n_niche_ is small**: after all, while we know not everyone likes [Jenses\nAckles/Jared Padalecki A/B/O\nfanfiction](https://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Alpha%2FBeta%2FOmega+Dynamics&work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&tag_id=Jensen+Ackles*s*Jared+Padalecki),\nwe know there's enough of them to effectively champion [one of the most famous\ntropes](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Alpha/Beta/Omega#History) in the fanfiction\nworld.\n\nThe reason understanding niches is fundamental is that, as entrepreneurship\nwisdom goes, **focusing on a specific niche is how small, emerging businesses\nsucceed over big, established ones.** While this might seem counterintuitive—and\nmost indie projects do indeed get this wrong—the reasoning is fairly\nstraightforward.\n\nLet's set the scene with some numbers:\n\n1.  In May 2019 [**2.8 millions** new Tumblr\n    blogs](https://unwrapping.tumblr.com/post/185963265017/tumblr-numbers-for-may-2019)\n    saw the light of day.\n2.  In May 2020, AO3 announced reaching [**2.5 millions** total registered\n    users](https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/15931).\n\nWhile there is not a 1:1 relationship between Tumblr blogs and number of users,\nknowing that **more Tumblr blogs were created in the single month of May 2019\nthan the overall number of AO3 users existing in May 2020** helps us understand\nthe magnitude of the gap between their respective target markets.\n\nNow, let's ask ourselves some questions: what were these 2.8 million new Tumblr\nblogs about? Which topics did they prominently feature? Who are the people that\ncreated them? What _need_ were they seeking to fill by creating their blog?\nThere are no easy, straightforward answers to these questions. Indeed, if you\nrandomly select two of these blogs, their creators are likely be very different\npeople.\n\nIn comparision, **we can make stronger assumptions about the 2.5 million AO3\nusers**: while we might not know whether they're gen fans or hardcore shippers,\nthey're likely to be invested consumers of popular media; we can also assume\nthat, because they signed up to AO3 over (or in addition to) Fanfiction.net or\nWattPad, they value the ability to filter their search according to specific\ntropes, characters or ship, and might dislike seeing ads alongside fanworks;\neven further, while this won't be true for everyone, we can imagine many of them\nto be aligned with the goals and principles at the core of the OTW. Because of\nthis higher degree of uniformity and specialization across its _niche_, **AO3\ncan prioritize working on aspects of its user experience that most other\nwebsites will instead see as secondary.**\n\nAs a practical example, let's take AO3's popular tagging system: at its core,\nthe reasons so much effort is put into it, is that **discoverability—and\n[recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall#Recall)!—is really\nimportant to the transformative fandom niche.** AO3's tagging system is a big\ndifferentiator over other similar offerings in the space, and one of the prime\nreasons people keep coming back and donating to the archive. In comparison,\nTumblr's search system is _far_ from being a core offering. And while it's\npossible that some level of improvement might be welcome by its audience, the\ntruth of the matter is that most people who made those 2.8 millions new Tumblr\nblogs _don't actually care that much_—or, at the very least, not as much as AO3\nusers. This means that, technical and practical issues aside, Tumblr might never\nbe able to justify investing in a similar system. After all, for all we know,\nmost of its users are perfectly content finding new blogs through word of mouth,\nalgorithmic suggestions, or external search engines.\n\n### Indie Projects and Market Niches\n\nWhat _niches_ mean for indie projects like BobaBoard is that, while they're\nunlikely to ever have the resources to win over all of Tumblr's public, **they\ncan \"capture\" a _highly-specialized segment_ of it by providing a specialized\nexperience that no big social will be able to match**. By having a well-defined,\nvery-specific [target audience](https://v1.bobaboard.com/faqs#ideal-user) a\nproduct like BobaBoard can avoid spending resources on the features its public\ndoesn't value, and focus on things like [building an advanced tagging\nsystem](https://www.bobaboard.com/features-deepdive#tags), supporting [different\ntypes of content\ndisplay](https://www.bobaboard.com/features-deepdive#creativity), and making it\neasy to [find the content people seek and ignore the ones they'd rather\navoid](https://www.bobaboard.com/features-deepdive#content-hierarchy).\n\nBut here's the catch: as discussed earlier, the distinction between \"niche\" as a\n_specialized segment of the market_ vs a _small segment of the market_ is\nfundamental. After all, **while highly-specialized segments of a market might be\nwilling to pay and support services catering to their specific needs**, the hard\ntruth is that **there still need to be enough people in the target segment to\neventually pay the bills**.\n\nThis is one of the reasons that, while many products start by targeting a\n_niche_, they eventually move on to capture additional segments. While this\nsometimes—not always!—results in a betrayal of the original audience (as sex\nworkers, people of color, and even fandom very well know), there's no way around\nsome degree of it: in order not to fail, even the most ethical of businesses\nwill be forced to expand its market until it finds its [Minimum Viable\nAudience](https://seths.blog/2017/07/in-search-of-the-minimum-viable-audience/).\n\n![](./paddles-throne.png)\n\nAt the very beginning, BobaBoard's target niche was \"people who think [dressing\nyour favorite character as the\nOnceler](https://www.bobaboard.com/onceler-shrine) is peak comedy\". With Realms,\nwe've now expanded to include \"those who think an iron throne made of yaoi\npaddles is (and [might even want one as a\nsticker](https://store.bobaboard.com/#!/Yaoi-Queen-Sticker-Vinyl/p/368943794/category=112843740))\".\n\nGoing further, when—or, better said, _if_—a business reaches an eventual\nequilibrium between costs and earnings, it will still be faced with a similar\nchoice:\n\n1.  **It can keep expanding its reach**, using its new-found cash flow and\n    position in the market to target new segments and broaden its offering;\n2.  or **it can leverage its steady revenue stream to keep delivering greater\n    value to its existing userbase**, without investing in further expansion.\n\nWhen the needs of the existing userbase remain in focus, no option is\nnecessarily superior to the other. After all, while the first road might take\ntake some energy away from catering to the original segment, it might still end\nup providing it more overall value than the second one ever will. If the goals\nand principles of the business are solid, expansion doesn't have to equate\nbetrayal. **It's when business expansions—if not total market dominance!—becomes\nthe goal in and of itself, when unprofitable businesses are artificially propped\nup by large investors to seek unfettered growth while operating at a loss for\nyears, that the whole system quickly falls apart.**\n\nBut that, dear reader, is a topic for another day.\n\n## The Last Month+ of BobaBoard\n\nSince time is running out, it's time to cheat delegate!
