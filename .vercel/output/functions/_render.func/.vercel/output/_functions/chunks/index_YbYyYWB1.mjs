As you can\nsee, she's really cool.\n\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nHello, BobaBoard community! **My name’s Michelle, and I’m helping Ms. Boba as a\nvolunteer assistant.** While much of this work is at a too early stage to dive\ndeep into—bummer!—let's just say: it involves building up BobaBoard as an\norganization, and figuring out its structure and processes.  \nI also did a lot of writing for this summary, and I’ll continue to ghost write,\nresearch, and support Ms. Boba until she manages to clone herself and can run\nBobaBoard on her own. Until then, I’ll be here lurking in the shadows.\n\n</aside>\n\n## August - September 2021\n\n### Volunteering\n\n**Our main focus area is building a sustainable environment for volunteers** by,\namong other things, delineating the fundamentals of good documentation, defining\nthe onboarding process for new folks, and building up processes and tools to\nmatch each volunteers to the project that best matches their skills, interests,\nand availability. As part of this, we’re reaching out to seasoned volunteers\nfrom various startups, nonprofits and fandom-orientated projects to talk about\nhow their volunteering programs work (or don't!).\n\nAs part of this, we realized that _a fundamental part of creating a functional\nvolunteers environment is writing down everything we know/decide about ongoing\nprojects_\\*, so that if a volunteer needs to drop out the next person can pick\nup right where they left off, and so there's a (electronic) paper trail of the\nchoices made. Here are some example from this month:\n\n---\n\n#### Conceptual/Design\n\nWhen creating a new thread or adding a comment or contribution to a post, you\ncan’t poke around the current page without either deleting what you wrote or\nsending the comment. [To solve this, we’re redesigning the\neditor](https://bobadocs.netlify.app/docs/product/WIPs/minimize-editor), making\nit possible to minimize it, move around the page, and pick up right where you\nleft off.\n\n![Example of editor work](./new-post-design.png)\n\n> \\[Volunteer Shoutout\\] Thank you to one of our wilfully anonymous volunteers\n> for the revamped \"block editor\" design (seen above). **Thank you so much,\n> secret designer!**\n\n#### UI implementation\n\nOur current GIF search interface leverages a non-BobaBoard library, making its\nlogic and look different from the rest of the website. To solve this, we’re\nlooking [to expand our dropdown menus code to include the ability to select\nbetween\nimage](https://bobadocs.netlify.app/docs/product/WIPs/extensible-dropdown).\n\n![Example of gif\nsearch](./gif-search.png)\n\n#### Technical\n\nInternal details about our current authentication mechanism are leaking into\nsome of our database queries. Trust us: this is bad. [Here’s a—not\ntaken!—project tackling this issue, while also making the queries less\ncumbersome and\nrepetitive](https://bobadocs.netlify.app/docs/engineering/WIPs/internal-uid).\n\n---\n\nThere's still a lot of work to be done to effectively manage volunteers and\ncreate a smooth process and experience, so expect to hear a lot about it in the\nfollowing months!\n\n### REST API Standardization\n\nOne of Ms. Boba most daunting-yet-necessary tasks at the moment has been\n**standardizing and documenting BobaBoard’s REST API.** For the uninitiated, an\nAPI is the contract through which clients communicate with the server, while\nREST is one of the golden standards for API definition\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).\n\n> “The REST architectural style emphasises the scalability of interactions\n> between components, uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components,\n> and the creation of a layered architecture to facilitate caching components to\n> reduce user-perceived latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy\n> systems”.\n\nStandardizing this API means people who are not Ms. Boba can make choices that\nare consistent with her own, and helps create a codebase that's easier to\nunderstand, modify and expand. As you can image, this significantly ties into\nthe [volunteering focus area](#volunteering) described above.\n\nAs part of this effort, we've spent time adding a whole pipeline to make\ncreating API documentation as seamless as possible. This means that **when we\nmake changes to BobaBoard’s API, our [work-in-progress documentation\nwebsite](https://bobadocs.netlify.app/docs/engineering/rest-api/) automatically\ndisplays the latest documentation** for everyone to peruse. In time, this will\nallow us to catch any mistakes that get our expectations out of sync with what’s\nactually happening, and get volunteers up to speed quickly and safely.\n\n[Ms. Boba wrote an article on some of the work\ndone](https://dev.to/essentialrandom/documenting-express-rest-apis-with-openapi-and-jsdoc-m68),\nthough the functionality is rapidly expanding to include even more bells and\nwhistles like automatic validation and testing.\n\n<figure>\n![A tweet reading \"Been doing serious documentation/engineering-guidelines/standardization to prepare for the Realms work outsourcing. Now I can confidently design APIs beforehand and not regret all my life choices in 3 months*. Anyway, look at the baby. *I’ll regret them in 7. Much better.\"](./twitter-screenshot.png)\n  <figcaption>\n\n[Original tweet](https://twitter.com/BobaBoard/status/1418022326918991876).\nScreenshotted for posterity on 10/19/2023 because... _you know_.\n\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n### Observability\n\nSince observability is a complicated concept ([you can read more about it in\nthis article](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/observability)), let's focus on a\nsummary of its main benefit:\n\n> The overarching benefit of observability is that with all other things being\n> equal, a more observable system is easier to understand (in general and in\n> great detail), easier to monitor, easier and safer to update with new code,\n> and easier to repair than a less observable system.\n\nKeeping it very simple, observability means you can keep track of the internal\nstate of the system so that, when errors happen, you can figure out what’s going\non without tearing your hair out.\n\nThis month we started using [honeycomb.io](https://www.honeycomb.io/) to\ndiscover errors in BobaBoard's server logic. It already allowed Ms. Boba to\nfigure out some of them were—maybe unsurprisingly—coming from Tumblr's\nmishandling of some embed requests. Oh, Tumblr.\n\n### Practical Coding\n\nAside from all this theoretical work, the practical one has been revamping a lot\nof how the server works (which also impacted the client, of course). As an\nexample, the notifications delivery architecture has been completely rewritten\nfrom scratch so it doesn’t make Ms. Boba feel gross when she looks at it.\n\nMuch of this is working toward the launch of Realms, and is vital to it: without\nlaying this solid foundation, Realms cannot happen or, at the very least, will\nmake writing new functionality harder and harder with time.\n\n> \\[Volunteer Shoutout\\] For this work, we would like to give a shout out to our\n> volunteer Sel who has been a great help in the [board\n> UUID](https://bobadocs.netlify.app/docs/engineering/WIPs/boards-uuid)\n> migration. This is something we really can’t do Realms without! **Thank you so\n> much, Sel!**\n\n### UI Mocks\n\nWe’ve been working on creating some premade UI mocks to help us iterate faster\nwhen making design changes, and get earlier feedback. For example, here's how we\nused our \"board page\" mocks to visualize how the sidebar might look in the\nfuture, including an exploration of potential new sections.\n\n![Screen-Shot-2021-09-16-at-6.21.36-PM](./sidebar-design.png)\n\nOf course, none of this is finalized! As said above, these are simply drawings\nwe’ll use in the future to gather feedback earlier in the process, or brainstorm\npotential changes/ideas.\n\nWe’re also working on more high-end mocks, but we’re not ready to share the\nlinks yet.\n\n---\n\n...and this is all for this month! As usual, let us know what you think (and\nwhat you want to see more of) [in the feedback\nform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8tUxa4v72CeUswgRf8yiFniLu8wtj3Ju6uBPYhHE__n2VWQ/viewform)!\n\nAnd if you want to support BobaBoard, you can [subscribe to the paid edition of\nthis newsletter](https://essentialrandomness.com/subscribe/) for only $5/month!\nNot ready to commit? What about [some custom\nmerchandise](https://store.bobaboard.com/) or even [a whole\nship](https://robinboob.com/)?\n\nSee you soon,  \nMichelle & Ms. Boba\n\n<style>{`\n  .intro {\n    padding: 0px 15px;\n    border: 1px dotted #ccc;\n    border-radius: 15px;\n    background-color: #f3f4f5;\n  }\n`}</style>\n";
