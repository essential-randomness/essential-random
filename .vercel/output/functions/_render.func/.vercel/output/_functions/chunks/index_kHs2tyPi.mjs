This effort took more than a\nmonth.\n\nI can't wait to code again. :bobatwt:\n\nBefore that, however, I had a couple things to tie up:\n\n### The Newsletter Survey\n\nWe have a \"topic of the month\" survey to figure out what my target audience\n(you) wants. Of course, I'm not going to do this manually. Instead, **I set up a\nwhole fancy pipeline** to automatically take care of the logistics.\n\nOne step further: [I documented it all on my own technical\nblog](https://dev.to/essentialrandom/sending-subscribers-surveys-with-ghost-pipedream-and-airtable-569i),\ndug up from its grave for the occasion. May this be the first of many\ndocumentations to come!\n\n### Privacy Concerns\n\nAs someone warned me (thank you!), [the blogging software I'm\nusing](https://ghost.org) is taking member names from Stripe despite me having\ndisabled them completely in the signup. I've opened [a support\nticket](https://forum.ghost.org/t/enable-not-saving-members-name-from-stripe/23874/2)\nto get it resolved. In the meantime, as you can read there, I did some code\nmagic and hacked away the behavior.\n\nIf this is a concern for you, **you can remove your name from [the account\nsettings page](https://essentialrandomness.com/account/).** Sorry about the\nissue! I do have a rant about how needlessly hard it is to not have other\npeople's names leaked to you when running an online business, which might find\nits way here at some point.\n\n### What's next for Boba\n\nNow that I can go back to what people are supposedly paying me for, I need to\nresist the urge to just _code code code_. No one more than me wants to put their\nhead down and whip up Realms in a month, but that will just make it harder and\nharder for others to help me out in the future. **If we go too quickly now,\nwe'll pay the price later.**\n\nSo here's a rundown of the focus areas I will need to untangle and fit into a\n_\\~coherent plan~_:\n\n1.  **Performance:** we definitely aren't where I want us to be, especially in\n    longer threads. While some of it will be solved on its own once [React\n    Concurrent\n    Mode](https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/06/08/the-plan-for-react-18.html)\n    launches, there's some work that needs to be done regardless (e.g.\n    lazy-loading of embeds, serving smaller images, swapping gifs for videos\\*).\n2.  **Quality of Life Improvements:** somewhat related to performance, but not\n    only. For example, _there's definitely something going on with random 500\n    errors_. Of course, I can look at the logs and solve these (and I will), but\n    I _really_ need better instrumentation so I don't have to wait for people to\n    complain before I act. **This is likely to be one of the first things I'll\n    focus on in the coming week.**\n3.  **Design Work:** \"design twice/code once\" sort of efforts. For example,\n    there's a lot we need to fit in those thread/board sidebars, and I'd rather\n    have a path charted before I start incrementally coding improvements. How do\n    we collaboratively work on the final result? How do I empower people to do\n    this work without me? That's part of the challenge that needs solving.\n4.  **Documentation:** stabilizing Boba for Realms is a perfect occasion to\n    write documentation and help volunteers do meaningful, impactful work\n    autonomously. And documentation is also the perfect chance to standardize\n    conventions and kick down some [technical\n    debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt). For example, I'm\n    looking into adding [OpenAPI-based\n    specs](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/start-here.html) to Boba's\n    backend endpoints.\n5.  **Current Hotspots:** working on more Realms doesn't mean the single ones\n    don't also need some love: from better support for deep threads, to search,\n    to crossposting, to accessibility, to... _a lot of small things_, \"the work\n    must go on\".\n6.  **Realms, of course:** there's a couple different ways I'm planning to\n    approach this. In the short term:\n\n    - **Admin Tools:** Realm admins will need to make new boards, new roles, new\n      identities... all things I've been doing directly through the DB. No more:\n      it's time to get us some nice UI.  \n      _\\[BobaLore: the 4/20 \"decoration settings\" page was prioritized knowing\n      we'd need the work for Realms\\]_.\n    - **API work:** All our server requests have, until now, not carried any\n      information about the Realm they originated from (understandably, since\n      there was only one). I'll need to go through each of them and add this\n      information, which is also a great chance for the _documentation_ work\n      highlighted above.\n    - **Backend Modularization:** does this user have permission to make this\n      post? Which set of identities should we select from when assigning a new\n      one? These checks, which are already happening, will be based on more and\n      more complex logic as time goes on. Some good architecture design done\n      now, will save pain later.\n\n    These aside, the _design work_ mentioned above will also feature some\n    realms-based effort, like the \"eagle eye view\"/\"welcome page\"/\"rules\n    explanation\" flow & screens.\n\n7.  **Code Candy:** those things that make my code worth coding even though they\n    might not be the \"highest priority\". Right now, \"emojis\", \"user badges\",\n    \"realm user pages\".\n\n...and that's... _a lot_. Please do let me know if you have thoughts, either\nwith the [usual anonymous\nform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewrGG-34xIgMPm89RLFOokincwAIEfpSh9ho19EGLJOJWTtA/viewform),\nor [by emailing me](mailto:essential.randomn3ss@gmail.com), or on Discord, or in any way\nyou can think of. If you're interested in more (or less) details, you can let me\nknow through the survey. _wink wink_ :bobaeyes::bobaeyes::bobaeyes:\n\n## From Ms. Boba's Calendar\n\nI'm going to have a bunch of meetings with prospect volunteers, stakeholders,\nand random people in the following weeks, but here's the coolest one: I've been\nintroduced to [Zulip](https://zulip.com/)'s CEO, and will have the chance to ask\nhim about how to foster a good open source collaboration environment (especially\nin these early stages). From their main page:\n\n> Zulip has a significantly larger and more active development community than\n> other modern open source group chat solutions like Mattermost, Rocket.Chat,\n> and matrix.org.\n\nWhat's the secret? I don't know. I'll report back with thoughts.\n\n## Final Notes\n\n...and with this, we're done for the first super quick edition! If you\nsubscribed to this newsletter, you should have received the survey by now. If\nyou haven't, [let me\nknow!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewrGG-34xIgMPm89RLFOokincwAIEfpSh9ho19EGLJOJWTtA/viewform)\n\n## See you soon!\n\n---\n\n### \\* Re: gifs vs videos\n\nI expect people to have a knee-jerk _\"no!! I hate videos in place of gifs!\"_\nreaction. I'm right there with you. But there's 2 main reasons this is needed:\n\n1.  **Gifs are really much, much slower to load than videos.** Any web\n    performance guide hammers this point down.\n2.  Gifs can't be paused, and **I need to be able to pause gifs for\n    accessibility reasons**.\n\nPersonally, I find not being able to save videos as gifs frustrating, so that's\none thing I'm going to make sure can still happen. If you have other particular\nfrustrations, do voice them and I'll look into it. This change isn't going to\nhappen overnight anyway, cause it's a non-trivial addition to the Boba backend\narchitecture.\n\n### Note: Who has access to this?\n\n**\\[UPDATE\\]: This is now publicly available!**\n\nFor these first editions, I'm currently surveying and giving immediate content\naccess to both paying and free members (but not the public, which will likely\nget it ~3-4 weeks after release). Paid members will still get \"stronger dibs\" on\nthe topics. I know who you are.\n\nIn the future, this will likely change. I'm also looking at other offerings that\nmight entice people to give some extra support. All this aside, the most\nimportant offering is **\"Boba keeps getting worked on and Ms. Boba cam afford to\nhire help so she doesn't crash and burn\"**. If you can, consider [becoming a\npaid member](https://essentialrandomness.com/subscribe/). If you can't,\n[consider letting me know what's stopping\nyou](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewrGG-34xIgMPm89RLFOokincwAIEfpSh9ho19EGLJOJWTtA/viewform).\n";
