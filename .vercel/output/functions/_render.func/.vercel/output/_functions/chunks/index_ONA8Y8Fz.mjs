In this tutorial, we will use the following\nprocessors:\n\n- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/): The most popular payment processor among\n  developers. As most payment processors out there, it's not friendly to NSFW\n  creators (blame credit card companies) so if your content toes the line of\n  what's allowed once again make sure to transfer out your money often.\n- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/): Probably the most famous payment processor\n  on the web. Not friendly to unconventional (read: NSFW) creators (make sure\n  not to mention that in your details, and to set up your account to transfer\n  out money often), but tends to be the preferred way to pay for many people,\n  especially in Latin American countries. To get the full power of PayPal, make\n  sure to create a **business account**.\n\n<div class=\"warning\">\n\nYou might need additional set up after you create an account in order to be able\nto use the features we'll discuss. Do reach out if you need help, and let me\nknow if this article needs more or updated information.\n\n</div>\n\n### Donations vs Tips\n\nTODO: use some words on the distinction and the legal warnings\n\n### How to Get Tips with Stripe\n\nThe easiest way to get tips with Stripe is by using their [payment\nlinks](https://stripe.com/docs/payment-links) feature. This feature allows you\nto select either a product to sell, a subscription or a donation, and (after\nsome setup) will give you a link to a checkout page that you can give to anyone\nto collect payments.\n\nThis is how the set up page looks when you select the donation option:\n\n![TODO:alt](./choose-what-to-pay-stripe.png)\n\nAs you play around with the settings, you'll see the preview of the checkout\npage update on the right. If you want to keep it simple, you don't need to mess\naround with settings, but you can explore advanced options for more fun\nopportunities. For example:\n\n- You can add **custom fields** to collect more information from payers. For\n  example, you could let people fill in information about a custom doodle in\n  exchange for their tip!\n- You can also **limit the number of payments** to only allow the link to be\n  used a certain number of times. This can be useful for anything you want to\n  keep \"limited edition\".\n\nMake sure to also check the \"after payment\" tab to confirm what users will see\nonce their payment is successful. You can either use Stripe's default page or\nyou can choose to redirect them to a specific page on your website.\n\n![TODO:alt](./after-payment-stripe.png)\n\n<div class=\"warning\">\n\nMake sure that neither of these pages are showing your personal information!\nMake sure to try making a few test payments yourself to ensure that Stripe isn't\nleaking data to the payer. Check your [public business details\npage](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) to hide or change\ninformation.\n\n</div>\n\n#### Stripe Customers Portal\n\nWhile this might not be necessary for one-time donations, subscriptions need a\nportal that allows people to manage their information. Luckily, Stripe offers a\npremade one. You can read more about [setting up a customer portal\nhere](https://stripe.com/docs/no-code/customer-portal).\n\n### How to Get Tips with PayPal\n\n#### PayPal.me\n\n[PayPal.me](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/) is PayPal equivalent to Stripe's\npayment links (but without the ability to sell a subscription or specific\nproduct). After setting this up, you will be given a link that allows anyone to\nsend you an amount of their choice. You can also request a specific amount by\nadding it at the end of your link. PayPal.me does not require a business account\nand can be used for everyday things like splitting bills.\n\nQuoting the [help\narticle](https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/what-is-paypalme-help432):\n\n> How do I request a specific amount via paypal.me? Just add the amount you want\n> to request to the end of your link. For example, use paypal.me/DiaRusso/25 to\n> request 25.00 USD. The request will be made in your default currency, which\n> you can change at any time in your PayPal Account settings. You can request a\n> specific currency by adding its code to the amount. To ask for Australian\n> Dollars, for example, you would use paypal.me/DiaRusso/25AUD.\n\n#### PayPal Donation Button\n\nIf you want the full power of the PayPal donation experience (and aren't selling\nspecific goods or services), you can use the [PayPal Donations\nButton](https://www.paypal.com/donate/buttons/manage). This allows a ton of\ncustomization (even more than Stripe) and works both as a link you can give out\non socials or as HTML code you can embed on your website.\n\n![TODO:alt](./paypal-options.png)\n\nOne fun bit that PayPal allows is actual fundraising campaigns with defined\ngoals. It also allows payers to choose between different preset amounts (which\nrequire separate payment links with Stripe), and to specify an \"initiative\" they\nwant their donation to go towards (which you can likely hack together with\nStripe custom fields).\n\n![TODO:alt](./campaign-page-preview.png)\n\nPayPal donation buttons also allow for recurring donations, so if you aren't\nlooking to sell products, this can be a good way to get no-strings-attached,\nrecurring tips from your supporters.\n\n<div class=\"warning\">\n\nSince there's a lot of possible options for PayPal donations, we won't go through\neach possibility. Let me know if you end up stuck, and I'll do my best to help!\n\n</div>\n\n#### PayPal Payments Buttons\n\nIf you want to actually sell things, and not simply accept donations, you can use\n[PayPal's Buttons integration](https://www.paypal.com/buttons/). There are a lot\nof different types of buttons (especially if you're logged in), but the ones you\nshould consider using are the \"smart payments button\" and the \"smart donations button\".\n\n![TODO:alt](./paypal-buttons.png)\n\nOnce again, there are _a lot of options here_ (including the ability to allow\npeople to set their own prices for products or add custom requests), but at the\nend of the flow you will once again get a link to a PayPal page with checkout\noptions (not available for subscriptions), as well as HTML code you can add to\nyour website to display the payment button there.\n\nCheck out [my subscriptions page](https://github.com/essential-randomness/essential-random/blob/97cff874198d07612e4d668c01d35cdc4d24e8a0/src/components/PayPalButton.tsx#L23)\nfor a few more options that you can add to this code, like the ability to not require\nshipping information or redirect the user to a specific page after payment.\n\n### How to Do Things when Payments Happen\n\nBoth PayPal and Stripe allow you to redirect the user to a specific page after payment,\nbut for anything more complex you will need a service that's able to receive webhooks.\n\nThe concept of webhook is beyond this guide. If you have some money to spend monthly\nZapier allows to react to both Stripe and PayPal events without needing to code, while\nPipeDream is a free option that however requires some coding abilities.\n\nStay tuned for a guide on webhooks, cause they're super cool!\n\n### Tradeoffs & Pitfalls\n\nWhile this is a cool way to avoid additional intermediaries between you and payment\nprocessors, there are a few downsides you should be aware of:\n\n- **Tax Handling:** Many 3rd parties will automatically handle taxes on your payments.\n  With this system, you will need to do so yourself. Make sure you consult an accountant\n  and/or check the laws of your place of residence.\n- **Leaking personal information:** If you aren't careful it can be easy to accidentally\n  leak personal information while using this method. Run a few tests yourself after setting\n  these up and make sure there's no information you want to hide available anywhere!\n- **Seeing personal information:** Since you'll be taking payments directly, you'll be\n  able to see information about your buyers that other 3rd parties (like Patreon) might\n  hide by default. While this might not be a problem for you, it might deter people from\n  using your links.\n\nThank you for reading through the end.

Let me know\nif this was useful, or if more details are needed by writing me on my socials.\n\nSee you soon!\n\n<style>{`\n    .warning {\n        background-color: yellow;\n    }\n`}</style>\n";
