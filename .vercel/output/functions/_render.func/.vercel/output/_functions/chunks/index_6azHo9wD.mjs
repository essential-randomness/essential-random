						const body = "\nIt's hard to have an objective discussion about freedom of the web. Even among\nallies, \"Open Web\" means different, sometimes-incompatible things to different\npeople.\n\nFor some people, \"freedom of the web\" is the dismantling of any large center of\npower, while for others \"freedom of the web\" means the current institutions have\nfailed, and new ones—preferably led by them—are bound to do significantly\nbetter. For some, \"freedom of the web\" must necessarily pass through large\namounts of decentralization, while for others decentralization is a misguided\ndream that inevitably begets new centralized structures. Even restricting\nourselves to Web3 proponents, some believe that \"freedom of the web\" can only be\nachieved by moving large swaths of our present infrastructure to the blockchain,\nwhile for others NFTs as speculative assets are a smokescreen distracting from\ntoken economics as a tool of community governance and grassroot organizing.\n\n<figure>\n  ![](./sometimes-decentralization-is-worse.png)\n  <figcaption>\n  \nSee, the problem goes beyond simple \"decentralization\". The big question is\n_what_ should be decentralized, and what decentralization would instead make\nharder without proportional benefits to the end user. In this essay, I will—\n\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nApproaching internet discussions with the understanding that others might use\nthe same words for different concepts is fundamental to their effectiveness—it\nbecomes too easy, otherwise, to pick and choose those we engage with, and single\nout the most misguided participants as a representation of the whole. When we\nfocus on tearing down points that many of those we're critiquing would disown,\nit makes it easier to dismiss valid objections as cherry-picking, and to single\nout misdirected arguments to escape the underlying points being made. In the\nend, no matter what freedom of the web means to you, no matter whether you think\nthe blockchain is the road to it or not, it's important to see either side as\ncomprised of people with different ideals, motivations, and—above\nall—_priorities_ behind their choices.\n\nRegardless of where any of us stand, however, one thing must be conceded to the\nWeb3 movement: it brought the topic of freedom of the web at forefront of online\ndiscussions with an effectiveness previous efforts could only dream of\nachieving. And now that \"the fight for the open web\" is here, we must ask\nourselves: why did Web3 succeed where previous initiatives failed? And what\nshould those who fight from a different angle do about it?\n\n## The Capital Sin of Web3\n\nWhile different people might see its presence as either a plus or an inherent\nflaw, it's important to acknowledge that money is a huge differentiator between\nclassic \"freedom of the web\" movements and the current \"blockchain revolution\".\nIndeed, one of the drives behind the popularity of Web3 is the dream that, if\nthey use their cards right, new players can right all the wrongs of Web2.0 while\nstill making bank in the process.\n\nThe reason any discussion must start by pointing this out is that, no matter the\nrelative merits and pitfalls of the underlying technological stacks, the\ndynamics introduced by large cash flows inevitably shape the outcome of any\nmovement: money makes it easier to attract talent to a mission, and gives even\nfar-fetched, half-assed attempts a shot at either succeeding or teaching others\nthrough failure; it focuses people and resources, giving them the economical and\nemotional space to do the work, while enabling them to overcome their own\nweaknesses by paying experts for the benefit of their full attention; above all,\nits presence or lack of it—and, most importantly, its _source_—influences who\ngets to lead the change, and inevitably shapes its roadmap. If nothing else,\nmoney has a way to make the revolution seem, if not _glamorous_, a lot easier\nthan it actually is.\n\n![](./might-work-for-us.png)\n\nTo me, if there is one capital (get it? _get it?_) sin of the mainstream Web3\nmovement, it's not—or at least _not just_—the technology itself, but how it\ngives even Venture Capitalists and big-tech CEOs (or such wannabes) the chance\nto roleplay at being revolutionaries without having to concretely weaken their\nown power. After all, we've already been in a very similar place: no one is more\ndissatisfied with the present state of Web2.0 than the starry-eyed developers\nwho, a decade ago, joined large Silicon Valley companies to \"change the world\".\nIndeed, when we point out the danger of using money and large investors as a\ndriver of change, it's not to sap the revolution, but to stop entrenched powers\nfrom _once again_ stealing people's revolutionary energy for what will turn out\nto be the Web3 version of selling ads.\n\n### The Masters' Cryptowallets Will Never Dismantle the Masters' Walled Gardens\n\nWhile it is tempting—_oh, so tempting_—to believe you can trick large investors\ninto financing their own demise, it is my personal experience, and the one of\nothers who've tried to spearhead \"change from the inside\", that\n**institutionalized capital does not reduce the power of institutionalized\ncapital**. While the revolutions it finances might weaken the _perceived_ power\nof entrenched institutions, in the short term, it's most often a controlled loan\nthat will be yanked away the moment compromise stops being advantageous.\n\nThe big lie Venture Capital sells to some Web3 proponents is that embracing the\nsame powers that turned Web2.0 into the present mess will result in a different\noutcome this time around. While it is true that some of the current dynamics\nmight change for the better, technology on its own cannot guarantee that the\nresulting ones won't be significantly worse. Even if big investors truly\nbelieved in an idealistic vision of freedom of the web, nothing says this\npurported dream is the same as ours in the ways that matter. Even further, there\nis no guarantee the race to freedom will be won by those with the right\nintentions, and no guarantee their idealistic vision will remain unchanged when\nthe opportunity to extract more profit at its expense inevitably presents\nitself. After all, as history says, even corporations that start with the stated\ngoal of not being evil are just a press release away from walking back on their\nprinciples.\n\nIf there is _one_ thing the modern tech landscape teaches us is that, while we\ncan never predict all the large-scale dynamics that what we build will\neventually engender, rushing into implementation without continuously\nquestioning how our products could make the world worse is a recipe for\ndisaster. And if this lesson has a corollary, it's that entrenched powers will\npretend to seek—even embrace—warnings and critiques, while failing to implement\nchange on any meaningful level. In many ways, we can turn to historical data to\nsee the writing on the wall: content silos do not simply exist because sharing\ndata is impossible, but because large social media companies have a vested\ninterest to not interoperate; you're not disallowed from embedding Instagram\ncontent into an external feed because it's technologically impossible, but\nbecause their TOS restricts the way its own API (or even simple web scraping)\ncan be used; and companies backed by large amount of capital have often used\n\"doing what's right for the end user\" as a temporary tactic to maximize value\nextraction after competition has been crushed.\n\n<figure>\n![](./ap-ready-to-go.png)\n  <figcaption>\n  \nWhile one should never trust Venture Capital with open protocols, if Web3 were\n_indeed_ about freedom of the web, we would have seen this shift happen _a long\ntime ago_.\n\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIf we are to lead a revolution, the question is not what happens in the short\nterm, or what happens in the best case scenario. When it comes to freedom of the\nweb, our job—even the one of Web3 supporters—is to practice defensive design and\nplan not for everything going right, but for everything going wrong.\n\n## There Is No Better Time to Fight for a Freer Web\n\nIf we don't believe that Web3 is the right answer, the big question becomes:\nwhat should we do about it all? Of course, we can keep pointing out all the ways\nin which blockchain is not the right technological solution, or all the ways the\nmovement throws away lessons already learned by previous efforts, or twists\nitself around into places it's not a natural fit for. I'm not saying we should\n(all) stop doing that. But whether something is the right solution for a given\nproblem, as anyone that has ever worked for a big corporation will tell you,\nnever quite matters as much as the political dynamics surrounding the choice.\nIndeed, were that not the case, the web of today wouldn't be in this position in\nthe first place.\n\nInstead, I want us to recognize that **there has never been a better time than\nthe present to actively fight our way towards a freer, more open web.** There\nare many reasons for this: more and more people are entering the tech community\nfrom diverse, often under-represented backgrounds, less and less primed to be\nswallowed by FAANG's false promises of changing the world; many within these\ncompanies—world-class level professionals with far-reaching expertise—have found\nthemselves betrayed by the institutions they helped build, and are itching to\nfill the void of meaning (and heal the burnout) they've been left to contend\nwith; the pandemic has shifted people's job priorities in a way that's\nadvantageous to small, socially-driven enterprises; the sustainability of open\nsource and independent software is at the forefront of the discussion, with many\nworking to find viable solutions; at the same time, guidance and resources for\nbootstrapped enterprises that wish to build away from large capital or within\nnontraditional organizational structures are now more accessible than ever.\n\nBut, above all, t**he brewing seed for a revolution of the web is the palpable,\nwidespread anger at what corporations have allowed it to become**. While\narguably still niche, this feeling has expanded to reach far beyond the tech\ncommunity and encompasses online creatives, internet subcultures, and even\nsimple bystanders. Indeed, if we were to go beyond money, the reason Web3 was\nable to take hold in the hearts of so many is that it builds upon a real\ndispleasure people feel, one that the older open web movement has failed to\neffectively build upon.\n\nGiven all this, now more than ever, it's important that we don't stop at \"no\nblockchain\". Now more than ever, our guiding question should be: \"what practical\nalternative are we going to offer?\"\n\n<figure>\n![](./make-things.png)\n  <figcaption>\n  \nfrom [indieweb.org](https://indieweb.org/)\n\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIf we believe in the technologies that already exist, we must use them to take\nconcrete steps towards our own version of the future.\n\n## The Best Way to Fight Is to Build\n\nThis is not to say that people haven't already been working in this area. Since\nbecoming interested in open, decentralized technologies—thank you, _2018 Tumblr\nporn ban_, for precipitating my radicalization—I've interacted with many that\nare tired and angry at the present status quo of the web. The landscape is, as\none can imagine, extremely varied: some groups roleplay doing the web like it's\n2001, eschewing the complexity of the modern software stack in favor of good ol'\nhand-written HTML; others form community around tending to their own gardens,\nimplementing decentralized protocols within their own projects, with no stated\nroadmap or strategy for large-scale adoption; and many plug software together\nfor their own pleasure, with no intention of making the results available to a\ncasual, non-technical public.\n\nNone of this is meant as a critique: in a world were value is too often equated\nwith productivity, building software for _fun_ rather than for _business_ is an\nanti-capitalist action worthy of protection. But, just like it's important for\nthe Web3 movement to acknowledge that the barriers to a decentralized, open web\ngo far beyond the lack of technological solutions, **it's important for us to\nalso understand that what Web3 is offering goes far beyond blockchain as a\ntechnology.** When you scratch below the surface, Web3 is a welcoming, bustling\ncommunity of individuals that create organizations (no matter how flawed) to try\nand bring about real, effective change; it's a plethora of resources for\nbeginners, of \"getting started\"s, and \"how to\"s, and Discord servers where\nquestions can be asked and connections can be forged; it's discussions about\nwhat the future should look like, paired with real energy that spurs people into\naction; it's the dream that, when they pool their talent, resources—and, yes,\n_money_—together, individuals have the power to effectively build a new web away\nfrom institutionalized powers. Like many things, Web3 has invented none of this,\nand yet is doing it more effectively than previous movements ever have.\n\nIn the end, harder to use, more confusing, less stable versions of what's\nalready out there will never be a viable strategy for long-term change. And\nwhile Web3 also struggles with the complexities of decentralized software, it's\nnot just selling it as a nerdy alternative to the mainstream, but as an exciting\nproblem to solve at scale. By organizing themselves in DAOs, and by embracing\ntoken economies, many Web3 projects recognize that individual work cannot\nmeaningfully move the needle without a coordinated effort, a roadmap, a mission,\nand the willingness to do what it takes to bring the future to a larger public.\nAnd, while I believe that the ability to pay for your right to vote on a roadmap\nis not what will unlock the web I want to see, not taking our own revolution\nseriously will all but ensure that others get to build it in our place.\n\n<figure>\n![](./strange-women-distributing-tokens.png)\n  <figcaption>\n  \nWhile I'm personally not sold on token economics, DAOs are an interesting space\nto observe as they experiment with new structures for online organizing.\n\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n**If we care about freedom of the web, we need to get serious about building the\nweb we want to see.** We must envision and create delightful software, based on\nexisting open protocols, that people want to use not just because it aligns with\ntheir ideals, but because it delivers them real value. We need to offer open,\nethical alternatives to the status quo that are both sustainable and useful, and\nwe must do the hard work of marketing and selling them to those primed to\nreceive them. We must build business models that allow us to pay people fairly\nfor their expertise, that recognize that lasting change shouldn't be built in\npeople's spare time, and that modern software requires people's full\nattention—not just of engineers, but of product managers, designers, admins, QA\ntesters, lawyers, artists, tech writers, marketers, moderators, community\nmanagers, support specialists, and countless others. At the same time, the\norganizations we create must be built to be resilient against both external and\ninternal attempts at thwarting their mission for the sake of profits (an\naspiration that inevitably closes down many traditional fundraising avenues),\nand must ensure they do not centralize power within themselves, or grow large\nenough to swallow each other.\n\nAll of this is anything but simple. But as long as we don't take building the\nfuture seriously, giving ourselves a real chance at achieving a different web at\nscale—not a _huge_ one, but an _impactful_ one—those with goals and ambitions\nincompatible with ours will continue to dominate the narrative. More and more\nbootstrapped, open source, _profitable_ software based on closed protocols is\nlaunched every day; more and more existing problems are solved with blockchain\ntechnology, even when unneeded; those of us that believe in open standards also\nhave the power to build _products_ and _companies_ that spearhead the principles\nwe ourselves believe in. Because, while it's true that the future of the\nindependent web will never be built by those who are doing it for money, it also\nwon't be built by those who treat it as a hobby.\n\n## Conclusion & Action Items\n\nFar from being the end of the story, the Web3 movement is an opportunity for\nthose that stand in opposition to it: if we truly believe the blockchain is\nnothing but a fad, if we're sure that people will eventually wise-up and realize\nthe promises they're being sold are bound not to materialize (or at least not in\nthe way being advertised), then the eventual crash and burn is a welcome\nchance—not to _gloat_, but to fill a void. While it might not align with our own\nvision of the future, Web3 buys us the time to plan and strategize, doing the\nimportant job of sensitizing public opinion on our behalf, while leaving us\nspace to build communities and software able to welcome those willing to go\nbeyond the short-term hype.\n\nAnd while I don't have all the answers (the right ones will take time, effort,\nand a lot of trials and errors), here are some potential actions to take:\n\n- Offer your expertise to those building towards the future you believe in. Make\n  yourself available within the limits of your possibilities, connect people\n  with experts in your network.\n- Create welcoming spaces (for both beginners and not) to ask questions. Build\n  communities, or help expanding existing ones.\n- Identify the largest roadblocks in the way of the future you want to see, and\n  write about topics you're familiar with in ways that are both useful and\n  accessible.\n- If it's within your means, pay for the indie software you use. Sponsor\n  projects that uphold your values, and recommend them to others. Be a\n  cheerleader. Understand that redirecting your finances towards those enacting\n  change is as effective as—or even more than—volunteering your time.\n- Help raising funds for causes you believe in. Create new ones. If you know\n  about avenues of sustainable financing, help connecting them with those\n  spearheading the changes you want to see.\n- Build your projects in public. Build _a public_.\n- Start small. Do not rush into solving every problem. If you wish to build\n  utilities or products that encourage the adoption of open technologies, learn\n  how to do so effectively. Learn about MVPs, product-market fit, ethical\n  entrepreneurship, and how to prioritize your work to effectively serve the\n  communities you wish to build for. Learn from the mistake and successes of\n  those who have built similar products in the past, even when the ethos of\n  those products does not align with yours.\n- Explore different avenues of funding, and identify those best aligned with\n  your goals. Don't be afraid to ask for money for the services you provide, but\n  don't let money overrule your principles.\n- Learn about different types of organizations (e.g. nonprofits, co-ops, and\n  anarchist collectives), but don't wait to have built complex structures before\n  starting to do the work. If you've led such organizations, offer your\n  expertise and guidance to those that are just beginning to.\n- Imagine a better future, and tell everyone about it. Start conversations.\n- Believe that change is possible, and that you have the power to bring it\n  forwards. Help others believe the same.\n\nAnd last, especially if you're a Web3 supporter that has made it to this point,\nunderstand that freedom of the web goes beyond a single technology or answer.\nBut above all, understand that a free web won't be built with money at its\ncenter, but on top of the connections it's uniquely suited to create.\n\n---\n\n## Parting Words\n\n...and with this, it's time for the extra stuff!
