It was [successfully funded\non\nKickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/essential-randomness/the-fujoshi-guide-to-web-development)\nand is currently in production.\n\n## The Premise (from the Kickstarter)\n\n> Boba-tan, BobaBoard mascot and fangirl extraordinaire, is very sad about the\n> state of the modern, corporate web. Unfortunately, while she keeps meaning to\n> (re)learn how to make her own websites, she's too busy shipping fictional\n> characters to find the time and motivation to study. Not to worry though,\n> because she (smart) has finally found the perfect solution: imagining web\n> development and other programming concepts as swoon-worthy <abbr\n> title=\"beautiful men\">ikemen</abbr>, and alternating her study sessions with\n> bouts of daydreaming about their <abbr title=\"if you know, you\n> know\">yaoi</abbr>-tastic interactions.\n>\n> The Fujoshi Guide to Web Development follows the adventures of Boba-tan's own\n> \"programming world\" self-insert as she learns web development straight from\n> the source: the hot personified technologies who contribute to the marvel that\n> is today's internet.\n\n## Story and Background\n\nThe 4th in the series of BobaBoard's April Fools' Day projects, The Fujoshi\nGuide to Web Development went from a tentatively-proposed idea (_\"I keep\nthinking about this idea, but it's too overboard even for me\"_) to a\nfully-fledged Kickstarter campaign in just about 2 months.\n\nFujoGuide is the culmination of what I've learned from nurturing beginner\nBobaBoard volunteers, and what I observed running the Fandom Coders community:\n\n1. Confusion around version control is the biggest barrier for beginners seeking\n   to contribute to open source projects they love.\n2. Currently available resources for web development are often outdated or\n   simplistic, and those tools and technologies that would make the lives of\n   hobbyist programmers easier are hidden behind layers of jargon targeted at\n   professionals.\n3. People's fear of teaching advanced concepts to beginners holds back the most\n   ambitious and motivated learners.\n4. While Git and GitHub can be scary and confusing to beginners, those who\n   persevere find them to be incredibly empowering tools, and can quickly get up\n   to speed with the basics if properly guided.\n\nWhile I lead the overall project and melded the technologies into a cohesive set\nof characters traits and relationship dynamics, the project was only possible thanks\nto the friends I made throughout my journey (as well as a few new allies) who came in\nto help with the writing, art, design, brainstorming, emotional support, and the incredible\namount of work that such a project requires.\n";
