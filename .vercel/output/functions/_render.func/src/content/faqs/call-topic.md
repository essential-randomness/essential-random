    When I say anything, I mean, well, <em>mostly</em> anything. Crying
    over the present state of fandom? Absolutely! Reading me your sexy
    fanfic? Totally fine. Venting about your overbearing boss? Been there,
    done that!
</p>
<p>
    As long as the subject is something two friends in fandom would
    &quot;reasonably&quot; discuss, then it&apos;s fair game! If a topic
    falls outside my own boundaries, I&apos;ll let you know with no
    judgement.
