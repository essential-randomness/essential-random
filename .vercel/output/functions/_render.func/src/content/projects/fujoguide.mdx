## The vision

A series of books (zines) to teach web development concepts, specifically
catering to hobbyists and self-learners who are stuck between the simplistic,
shallow tutorials for beginners, and the dense, jargon-filled documentation for
professionals.

Rather than shying away from the complexity of modern web development, The
Fujoshi Guide to Web Development (informally known as _FujoGuide_) gently
introduces readers to concepts most beginners guides shy away from, trusting in
their innate desire for mastery and growth, and giving them the tools to build
more ambitious and complex projects.

"Volume 0: Git & GitHub" focuses on how to use version control for both personal
projects and to collaborate on open source software. It was [successfully funded
on
Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/essential-randomness/the-fujoshi-guide-to-web-development)
and is currently in production.

## The Premise (from the Kickstarter)

> Boba-tan, BobaBoard mascot and fangirl extraordinaire, is very sad about the
> state of the modern, corporate web. Unfortunately, while she keeps meaning to
> (re)learn how to make her own websites, she's too busy shipping fictional
> characters to find the time and motivation to study. Not to worry though,
> because she (smart) has finally found the perfect solution: imagining web
> development and other programming concepts as swoon-worthy <abbr
> title="beautiful men">ikemen</abbr>, and alternating her study sessions with
> bouts of daydreaming about their <abbr title="if you know, you
> know">yaoi</abbr>-tastic interactions.
>
> The Fujoshi Guide to Web Development follows the adventures of Boba-tan's own
> "programming world" self-insert as she learns web development straight from
> the source: the hot personified technologies who contribute to the marvel that
> is today's internet.

## Story and Background

The 4th in the series of BobaBoard's April Fools' Day projects, The Fujoshi
Guide to Web Development went from a tentatively-proposed idea (_"I keep
thinking about this idea, but it's too overboard even for me"_) to a
fully-fledged Kickstarter campaign in just about 2 months.

FujoGuide is the culmination of what I've learned from nurturing beginner
BobaBoard volunteers, and what I observed running the Fandom Coders community:

1. Confusion around version control is the biggest barrier for beginners seeking
   to contribute to open source projects they love.
2. Currently available resources for web development are often outdated or
   simplistic, and those tools and technologies that would make the lives of
   hobbyist programmers easier are hidden behind layers of jargon targeted at
   professionals.
3. People's fear of teaching advanced concepts to beginners holds back the most
   ambitious and motivated learners.
4. While Git and GitHub can be scary and confusing to beginners, those who
   persevere find them to be incredibly empowering tools, and can quickly get up
   to speed with the basics if properly guided.

While I lead the overall project and melded the technologies into a cohesive set
of characters traits and relationship dynamics, the project was only possible thanks
to the friends I made throughout my journey (as well as a few new allies) who came in
to help with the writing, art, design, brainstorming, emotional support, and the incredible
amount of work that such a project requires.
