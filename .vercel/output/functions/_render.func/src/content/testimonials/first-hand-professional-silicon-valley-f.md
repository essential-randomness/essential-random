**No one else working on a nascent fandom project has both
first-hand professional Silicon Valley FAANG tech expertise and
"trash panda" fandom expertise.** This makes Ms. Boba uniquely positioned
to responsibly and competently wield the necessary Big Tech skills (such as
networking + recruiting + estimating + training, and other "starting/running a
tech project" needs) for a fandom tech-based project.
