I trust Ms. Boba's efforts to shape better spaces for fandom to succeed because
she makes thoughtful, deliberate decisions about user experience - not just
based on her own wants and needs, but based on the feedback of people with
experiences different than her own. **She knows that you can't please everyone,
but does trust that everyone has something valuable to say**, and ultimately is
looking to build a fandom tools that can be adaptable to a variety of wants and
needs. She knows that slow and steady will win the race because it will give us
stable tools.
