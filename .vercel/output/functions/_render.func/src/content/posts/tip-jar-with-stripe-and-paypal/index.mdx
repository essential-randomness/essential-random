## Set up

In this article, we're going to show you how to create a tip jar with PayPal and
Stripe, the easy way!

### What you need

In order to set up your tip jars you will need an account with the payment
processor that you wish to use. In this tutorial, we will use the following
processors:

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/): The most popular payment processor among
  developers. As most payment processors out there, it's not friendly to NSFW
  creators (blame credit card companies) so if your content toes the line of
  what's allowed once again make sure to transfer out your money often.
- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/): Probably the most famous payment processor
  on the web. Not friendly to unconventional (read: NSFW) creators (make sure
  not to mention that in your details, and to set up your account to transfer
  out money often), but tends to be the preferred way to pay for many people,
  especially in Latin American countries. To get the full power of PayPal, make
  sure to create a **business account**.

<div class="warning">

You might need additional set up after you create an account in order to be able
to use the features we'll discuss. Do reach out if you need help, and let me
know if this article needs more or updated information.

### Donations vs Tips

TODO: use some words on the distinction and the legal warnings

### How to Get Tips with Stripe

The easiest way to get tips with Stripe is by using their [payment
links](https://stripe.com/docs/payment-links) feature. This feature allows you
to select either a product to sell, a subscription or a donation, and (after
some setup) will give you a link to a checkout page that you can give to anyone
to collect payments.

This is how the set up page looks when you select the donation option:

As you play around with the settings, you'll see the preview of the checkout
page update on the right. If you want to keep it simple, you don't need to mess
around with settings, but you can explore advanced options for more fun
opportunities. For example:

- You can add **custom fields** to collect more information from payers. For
  example, you could let people fill in information about a custom doodle in
  exchange for their tip!
- You can also **limit the number of payments** to only allow the link to be
  used a certain number of times. This can be useful for anything you want to
  keep "limited edition".

Make sure to also check the "after payment" tab to confirm what users will see
once their payment is successful. You can either use Stripe's default page or
you can choose to redirect them to a specific page on your website.

![TODO:alt](./after-payment-stripe.png)

<div class="warning">

Make sure that neither of these pages are showing your personal information!
Make sure to try making a few test payments yourself to ensure that Stripe isn't
leaking data to the payer. Check your [public business details
page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) to hide or change
information.

</div>

#### Stripe Customers Portal

While this might not be necessary for one-time donations, subscriptions need a
portal that allows people to manage their information. Luckily, Stripe offers a
premade one. You can read more about [setting up a customer portal
here](https://stripe.com/docs/no-code/customer-portal).

### How to Get Tips with PayPal

#### PayPal.me

[PayPal.me](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/) is PayPal equivalent to Stripe's
payment links (but without the ability to sell a subscription or specific
product). After setting this up, you will be given a link that allows anyone to
send you an amount of their choice. You can also request a specific amount by
adding it at the end of your link. PayPal.me does not require a business account
and can be used for everyday things like splitting bills.

Quoting the [help
article](https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/what-is-paypalme-help432):

> How do I request a specific amount via paypal.me? Just add the amount you want
> to request to the end of your link. For example, use paypal.me/DiaRusso/25 to
> request 25.00 USD. The request will be made in your default currency, which
> you can change at any time in your PayPal Account settings. You can request a
> specific currency by adding its code to the amount. To ask for Australian
> Dollars, for example, you would use paypal.me/DiaRusso/25AUD.

#### PayPal Donation Button

If you want the full power of the PayPal donation experience (and aren't selling
specific goods or services), you can use the [PayPal Donations
Button](https://www.paypal.com/donate/buttons/manage). This allows a ton of
customization (even more than Stripe) and works both as a link you can give out
on socials or as HTML code you can embed on your website.

![TODO:alt](./paypal-options.png)

One fun bit that PayPal allows is actual fundraising campaigns with defined
goals. It also allows payers to choose between different preset amounts (which
require separate payment links with Stripe), and to specify an "initiative" they
want their donation to go towards (which you can likely hack together with
Stripe custom fields).

![TODO:alt](./campaign-page-preview.png)

PayPal donation buttons also allow for recurring donations, so if you aren't
looking to sell products, this can be a good way to get no-strings-attached,
recurring tips from your supporters.

<div class="warning">

Since there's a lot of possible options for PayPal donations, we won't go through
each possibility. Let me know if you end up stuck, and I'll do my best to help!

#### PayPal Payments Buttons

If you want to actually sell things, and not simply accept donations, you can use
[PayPal's Buttons integration](https://www.paypal.com/buttons/). There are a lot
of different types of buttons (especially if you're logged in), but the ones you
should consider using are the "smart payments button" and the "smart donations button".

![TODO:alt](./paypal-buttons.png)

Once again, there are _a lot of options here_ (including the ability to allow
people to set their own prices for products or add custom requests), but at the
end of the flow you will once again get a link to a PayPal page with checkout
options (not available for subscriptions), as well as HTML code you can add to
your website to display the payment button there.

Check out [my subscriptions page](https://github.com/essential-randomness/essential-random/blob/97cff874198d07612e4d668c01d35cdc4d24e8a0/src/components/PayPalButton.tsx#L23)
for a few more options that you can add to this code, like the ability to not require
shipping information or redirect the user to a specific page after payment.

### How to Do Things when Payments Happen

Both PayPal and Stripe allow you to redirect the user to a specific page after payment,
but for anything more complex you will need a service that's able to receive webhooks.

The concept of webhook is beyond this guide. If you have some money to spend monthly
Zapier allows to react to both Stripe and PayPal events without needing to code, while
PipeDream is a free option that however requires some coding abilities.

Stay tuned for a guide on webhooks, cause they're super cool!

### Tradeoffs & Pitfalls

While this is a cool way to avoid additional intermediaries between you and payment
processors, there are a few downsides you should be aware of:

- **Tax Handling:** Many 3rd parties will automatically handle taxes on your payments.
  With this system, you will need to do so yourself. Make sure you consult an accountant
  and/or check the laws of your place of residence.
- **Leaking personal information:** If you aren't careful it can be easy to accidentally
  leak personal information while using this method. Run a few tests yourself after setting
  these up and make sure there's no information you want to hide available anywhere!
- **Seeing personal information:** Since you'll be taking payments directly, you'll be
  able to see information about your buyers that other 3rd parties (like Patreon) might
  hide by default. While this might not be a problem for you, it might deter people from
  using your links.

Thank you for reading through the end. If you do want to test this live (and see more
articles like this), head to my ["support me" page](/support-me#donate)! Let me know
if this was useful, or if more details are needed by writing me on my socials.

See you soon!
