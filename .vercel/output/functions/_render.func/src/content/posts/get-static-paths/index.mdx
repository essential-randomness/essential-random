## What `getStaticPaths` does in Astro (and theoretically NextJS)

Static Site Generators (SSGs) don't create pages on demand when a visitor
requests them. Instead, they generate them all ahead of time (the so-called
_"build time"_) before your site is uploaded to the web. This creates a problem
when page definitions have parameters within their URLs: **if a URL is of the
form `/posts/[postSlug]`, what are all the possible valid values that
`[postSlug]` can have?** Without knowing this, your SSG cannot know what pages
it's being asked to generate. This is the question that `getStaticPaths` exists
to answer.

## `getStaticPaths` and URL parameters

When an SSG goes to generate a page that has a dynamic parameter, it first
searches the code within in search of an _exported_ function (the only ones it
can see) named `getStaticPaths`. When called, this function will give the SSG
the list of all the pages it needs to work its magic on. The form this list
takes is **an array made up of one JavaScript object per page with the values of
the URL parameter(s) for that page.**

Let's leverage TypeScript to show what this looks like:

```ts
type PageParameters = {
  postSlug: string;
};

type ParametersForEachPage = Array<{
  params: PageParameters;
}>;

// A function that takes no inputs, and returns ParametersForEachPage.
type getStaticPaths = () => ParametersForEachPage;
```

Or, for a concrete example:

```ts
// Since getStaticPaths often uses data that is loaded via network
// or filesystem request, the function will be async and the return
// value wrapped in a promise. If you don't know what that means,
// just ignore it: the broad concept remains the same.
export async function getStaticPaths(): Promise<ParametersForEachPage> {
  return [
    { params: { postSlug: "my-shipping-manifesto" } },
    { params: { postSlug: "typescript-is-your-friend-i-swear" } },
    { params: { postSlug: "thirstposting-as-bonding-activity" } },
  ];
}
```

This will generate 3 pages:

1. `/posts/my-shipping-manifesto`
2. `/posts/typescript-is-your-friend-i-swear`
3. `/posts/thirstposting-as-bonding-activity`

If you want, you can stop here: **this is all your SSG needs to start using `getStaticPaths`.**

## `getStaticPaths` and props

If you want to go deeper, however, there is yet another thing that
`getStaticPaths` can do for you: given that it already has to work to produce
the value of the URL parameters for every page (a task that might require
potentially-expensive data loading), wouldn't it be neat if it could use that
chance to **also tell the SSG about the dynamic properties ("`props`") that
change page by page**?

Continuing our blog example, our dynamic properties could be `tags`, `title`,
`created_at`, and mostly anything that depends on the specific post and that we
want to avoid having to recalculate later. **The SSG doesn't really care what
`props` you give it (and if you give any)**: it will simply pass them as-is to
each page as it goes generate it, similarly to how we manually pass props to
components.

Our TypeScript signatures will then become:

```ts
type PageParameters = {
  postSlug: string;
};

type PageProperties = {
  tags: string[];
  title: string;
  created_at: Date;
};

type DataForEachPage = Array<{
  params: PageParameters;
  props: PageProperties;
}>;

// A function that takes no inputs, and returns DataForEachPage.
type getStaticPaths = () => DataForEachPage;
```

In practice, our function will now look like this:

```ts
export async function getStaticPaths(): Promise<GetStaticPathReturnValue> {
    return [
        // Our shipping post
        {
            params: { postSlug: "my-shipping-manifesto" },
            props: {
                tags: ["fandom", "shipping"],
                title: "Why I am Right and You are All Wrong",
                created_at: new Date('December 31, 2023 23:59:00')
            }
        },
        // Our typescript-defense-squad post
        {
            params: { postSlug: "typescript-is-your-friend-i-swear" } },
            props: {
                tags: ["coding", "typescript", "beginners"],
                title: "Be kind to him, he's just trying to help",
                created_at: new Date('January 5, 2024 16:20:00')
            }
        },
        // And so on so on...
    ];
}
```

Note that **unlike params (that the SSG must have to know what to generate), props
are completely optional**: if we preferred, we could simply load the post data
again in the page itself by using the value in the `postSlug` URL parameter.
"Props" is simply a "since we're here, we might as well" convenience.

## `getStaticPaths` and content collections

In Astro, `getStaticPaths` is often used in tandem with content collections. There's
nothing particularly special about using `getStaticPaths` this way, but let's go through
how such code typically looks bit by bit, and make sure that what's happening is clear.

Once again, our goal is to let the SSG know about:

1. The value of `postSlug` for each one of our posts
2. The properties that change page by page (we'll assume this is
   every property of `entry.data` for our collection, plus the function to render
   the content)

```ts
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // If you're already loading this in the page itself, you cannot reuse it here:
  // assume that getStaticPaths exists on its own and has no access to anything else
  // on the file you're writing: it can only see what's written within it.
  const blogEntries = await getCollection("posts");
  // Given an array, map will run the function for each entry, and put the returned
  // value in a new array (at the same position). This tells the SSG to generate a
  // page for each entry in our collection.
  return blogEntries.map((blogPost) => {
    return {
      // Content collections give us a nice slug for each entry, kindly
      // precalculated for us. This is the mandatory part.
      params: { postSlug: blogPost.slug },
      // The properties that change for every rendered page. This is a simple
      // convenience since we have all the data available here.
      props: {
        // Our "renderContent" prop will contain the function that renders the blog
        // post content. Rather than calling the function, we assign its value
        // to the renderContent property, like we'd do for any other variable.
        // In practice, calling renderContent() will be the same as calling render().
        renderContent: blogPost.render,
        // We spread the content of blogPost.data in the returned object, so that
        // we have a prop for each value in the data, rather than the whole data
        // object as a single prop.
        ...blogPost.data,
      },
    };
  });
}
```

Calling this `getStaticPaths` yields a similar result to the above version: an array with
one entry for each entry in your collection, with the value of the `postSlug` URL
parameter, and `props` that contain the dynamic data for each page.

```ts
export async function getStaticPaths(): Promise<DataForEachPage> {
    return [
        // Our shipping post
        {
            params: { postSlug: "my-shipping-manifesto" },
            props: {
                renderContent: /*a function to render the blogpost content*/,
                tags: ["fandom", "shipping"],
                title: "Why I am Right and You are All Wrong",
                created_at: new Date('December 31, 2023 23:59:00')
            }
        },
        // Our typescript-defense-squad post
        {
            params: { postSlug: "typescript-is-your-friend-i-swear" } },
            props: {
                renderContent: /*a function to render the blogpost content*/,
                tags: ["coding", "typescript", "beginners"],
                title: "Be kind to him, he's just trying to help",
                created_at: new Date('January 5, 2024 16:20:00')
            }
        },
        // And so on so on...
    ];
}
```

Or in TypeScript terms:

```ts
type PageParameters = {
  postSlug: string;
};

type PageProperties = {
  // Warning: AstroComponent is not the real type, but don't worry about that.
  renderContent: () => Promise<AstroComponent>;
  tags: string[];
  title: string;
  created_at: Date;
};

type DataForEachPage = Array<{
  params: PageParameters;
  props: PageProperties;
}>;

// A function that takes no inputs, and returns DataForEachPage. Since
// content collections have an asynchronous loader, this function will return a
// promise. Luckily, Astro is chill with that.
type getStaticPaths = () => Promise<DataForEachPage>;
```

### Optional Trick (Advanced): pre-render components within `getStaticPaths`

<details>
  <summary>Show me the trick!</summary>
  <div>
    If you want to *directly return the rendered component* (rather than the
    function to render it), you will run into a problem: the `render` function is
    an `async` function (that is returns a `Promise`), which means the function you
    call to `map` every element of the array will also need to be `async` (and thus
    return a `Promise`).

    In TypeScript terms:

```ts
// Same as before
type PageParameters = {
  postSlug: string;
};

// Now our properties include Content (the actual component) instead of renderContent (a reference
// to the function to render the content)
type PageProperties = {
  // Instead of being a reference to the function `render`, this is now the result of calling
  // `await render()`
  Content: AstroComponent;
  tags: string[];
  title: string;
  created_at: Date;
};

// OOOPS, now this is an array of promises! This makes Astro very confused.
type DataForEachPage = Array<
  Promise<{
    params: PageParameters;
    props: PageProperties;
  }>
>;
```

    If we want to pre-render the content, we can fix this in a somewhat-simple way: by waiting for
    all the promises in the array to be resolved, and thus turning `DataForEachPage` back
    to a simple array of objects. This is done using `Promise.all(array)`, which takes an
    array of `Promise` and waits for them all to be resolved.

```ts
export async function getStaticPaths() {
    const blogEntries = await getCollection("posts");
    // We tell astro to wait for all promises in the array to be resolved before
    // reading the value.
    return Promise.all(
        // Since we added async to the function passed to map, we're now returning
        // an array of Promises (which will be waited on by Promise.all)
        blogEntries.map(async (blogPost) => {
        return {
            params: { postSlug: blogPost.slug },
            props: {
                // We now return the content component directly (note the first-letter-uppercase
                // convention, typical of components). Since `post.render` is an async function
                // it will need to be awaited, which is what forced us to add async
                // to the function passed to `map` and to have to use Promise.all.
                Content: await post.render(),
                ...blogPost.data,
            },
        };
    });
}
```

    Now we're back to the previous type signature, and all's right with ~~the world~~
    Astro.

    We can then use the rendered component in our `.astro` files by doing:

```astro
---
const { Content, tags, title, created_at } = Astro.props;
---

{title}
Published on: {created_at}

<Content />

```

    </div>

</details>

## How do I use these values in my pages?

Astro has its own way to get these values in your page, using the special `Astro` object
that is available in every `.astro` file. Simply access the `params` and `props` elements
in this object to get your values.

### Params

```ts
// Remember: this destructuring is equivalent to
// const postSlug = Astro.params.postSlug;
const { postSlug } = Astro.params;
```

### Props

Props work exactly as it would be in any component that accepts props:

```astro
---
const { renderContent, tags, title, created_at } = Astro.props;

// If you want to use the rendered content you can render it and
// then use it as any other tag. Note we capitalize the first letter
// of content to remind ourself that's a component.
const Content = await renderContent();
---

{title}
Published on: {created_at}

<Content />
```

## Final TypeScript typing

Here's the final typescript types of the whole thing, which (if you've surrendered
to the power of our Lord TypeScript) will help you remember how the concepts are related:

```ts
type PageParameters = {
  postSlug: string;
};

type PageProperties = {
  renderContent: () => Promise<AstroComponent>;
  tags: string[];
  title: string;
  created_at: Date;
};

type DataForEachPage = Array<{
  params: PageParameters;
  props: PageProperties;
}>;

// Astro will resolve that Promise for us, so we don't need to do anything
// special with it. If Promises confuse you, you can pretend they're not here
// in this case.
type getStaticPaths = () => Promise<DataForEachPage>;

// The type of Astro.params will then be the same as PageParameters
type AstroParams = {
  postSlug: string;
};

// And the type of Astro.props will then be the same as PageProperties
type AstroProps = {
  renderContent: () => Promise<AstroComponent>;
  tags: string[];
  title: string;
  created_at: Date;
};
```

...and that is all! Go forth and use the power of `getStaticPaths` and let me know
if anything is unclear.
