        <p>
          If you've been looking at all the projects, memes, and general
          endeavors I've been up to and thought "wow, I'm glad someone is
          finally doing this, I wish they keep doing this, and maybe even more
          stuff like this", I have news for you: you can help me get more{" "}
          <strike>chaos</strike> beauty into the web (and help me pay my rent)
          by donating to my cause, and help ensure I don't need to go back to
          help some large company sell more ads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Donation tiers might offer specific rewards, but there's only thing I
          hold myself fully responsible to consistently deliver: with your
          support, I'll continue building my chaotic empire, educating people on
          how to build their own chaotic empires, and I'll keep making the
          resulting projects and knowledge as free, ethical, and accessible as I
          can reasonably can.

          <p>
            You do you. Patreon takes a certain percentage of earning and they
            kind of are a shitty company. I like Ko-fi more.

            You can log in to your PayPal account and manage all your
            subscription. For Stripe, <a href="">click here</a> for the customer
            portal.

          <summary>What if I'm currently on the old $5/month plan?</summary>
          <p>
            You can keep that, and be automatically considered for the "almond
            butter toast" support tier as a thank you for donating before it was
            cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to up your amount, you can cancel that subscription and
            create a new one. As long as it's using the same email, I'll make a
            note to leave you at least as "almond butter toast", regardless of
            amount.
