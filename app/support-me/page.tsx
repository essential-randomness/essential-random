        <div>
          <p>
            In 2020, I quit my job as a Silicon Valley software engineer on a
            mission to bring the internet back to the place of joy and
            creativity I grew up in.
          </p>
          <p>The initiatives I launched and am currently leading include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              BobaBoard, a privacy-centric, open source, forum-like software for
              online communities{" "}
            </li>
            <li>
              Fandom Coders, a 200+ people community where expert and beginners
              coders in fandom meet for friendship, support and learning
            </li>
            <li>
              Random fun stuff, including RobinBoob (a "ship-ownership
              certificates" marketplace parodying the NFT craze), and FujoBoard
              (a reimagining of the old Yaoi paddles phenomenon for the modern
              fangirl)
            </li>
          </ul>
          I've also introduced many people in fandom (often members of
          communities under represented in tech) to open source and web
          development, and I'm actively working on related educational material.
