  A series of plugins for popular software, from remark/rehype to Zod to 
  Astro. Used by many FujoVerseâ„¢ projects, they span from [automated loading
  alt text](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins/tree/main/remark-alt-text-files) in markdown files, to [loading social media URL details](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins/tree/main/zod-transform-socials)
  using Zod, to advanced wrangling of [Astro components in MDX files](https://github.com/FujoWebDev/fujocoded-plugins/tree/main/astro-remark-collect-components)...and way more!
