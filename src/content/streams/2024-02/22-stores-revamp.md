title: "Wrangling our $tores: Shopify Edition"
description: |
  The stores for our physical products ([FujoBoard](https://fujoboard.com/), [Merch](https://store.bobaboard.com/)) are currently managed through [Ecwid](https://www.ecwid.com/)! Unfortunately,
  Ecwid's API has been–pardon our french–a *pain in the ass*. In this stream, we'll begin moving
  to Shopify, and learn how to use  [an Astro website starter](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-shopify/)!
