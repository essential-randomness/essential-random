description: |
  On this edition of "decentralization corner", we look at one of the up-and-coming technologies in the
  social networks space: [@proto](https://atproto.com/), the protocol behind BlueSky. If time permits,
  we'll also look into [generating a custom feed](https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator) of Fandom Coders!
