title: "BobaBoard Stream: Life of a Post"
description: |
  For this BobaBoard stream, we'll go through everything that happens when a user types a 
  post to when the post is saved on the server and displayed within the thread. Both a 
  great chance for some documentation, and a great chance to learn more about how clients/servers
  work.
