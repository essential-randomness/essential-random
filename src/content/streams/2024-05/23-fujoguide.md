title: "[Tentative] Let's Work on FujoGuide!"
description: |
  [FujoGuide](https://fujoweb.dev) Volume 0 is our guide to Git & GitHub, and the
  protagonist of our [first-ever Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/essential-randomness/the-fujoshi-guide-to-web-development). Why many people know this already, what they 
  might not know is that the current edition of our guide is built, like many of our websites, 
  using Astro!

  In this (tentative) edition, let's do a deep dive on how we're using Astro to
  build a book, and do some much needed progress on the technical aspects of FujoGuide's
  delivery.
