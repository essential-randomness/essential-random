description: |
  Let's get back into the swing of things by finishing the $ponsors shrine! This is 
  a special section of [fujocoded.com](https://www.fujocoded.com) dedicated to thanking
  those who went above and beyond with their donations.

  In this edition, we'll put the finishing touches to the styling of our shrine, learn
  how to make a vertical-scrolling marquee, use HTML templates and respond
  to click events.
