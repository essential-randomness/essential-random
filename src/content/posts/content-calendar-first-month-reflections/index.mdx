## Content calendaring: the good, the bad, and the practical

As you might/might not know, **one of my new year resolutions is to keep a content
calendar for every month of 2024**, and do my best to stick to it so I can
_finally_ have some content in this blog.

While I had tried and very much failed to keep such calendar before, **this year
I managed (_at least as of January_) to push through my past hangups and deliver
some Juicy Content™**. Without sugarcoating it, this was an emotionally charged
journey. There is a lot I don't yet _love_ about creating content, but I'm happy I
took the plunge and somewhat landed on two feet.

With this first month behind me, it's time to look back at this trial and share
a few thoughts on what [was good about it](#the-good), what was [less
good](#the-bad), and some hard numbers on [what the result of it
was](#the-practical).

<details>
<summary> Bonus thoughts: Why I succeeded this year</summary>

1. **I got practice:** promoting the FujoGuide Kickstarter was an incredible
   amount of work, the most grueling part of which was maintaining a calendar
   and writing content every day for a month straight. As usual, at least for
   me, "swim or sink" is a very efficient, (mostly, with hindsight) "enjoyably
   stressful" way to learn.
2. **I got schooled:** in December, I did a small content trial: I tried
   streaming twice a week for a month straight. Unfortunately, I'm sad to report
   that "you need to publish on a consistent schedule to grow a public" is not a
   Big Content™ ploy to personally vex me.
3. **I got motivated:** tl;dr, I gave myself until August to prove to myself
   that [my ambitious
   plan](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts/enter-the-fujoverse) _can_
   work. Unfortunately, I realized, people cannot support what they don't know
   about–even if telling them about it takes time and energy away from working
   on the thing itself.

## The good

### I learned to care about the who and why

As _"the poster child for ADHD"_, I unwittingly perceive my time (and energy
reserves) as vague, nebulous entities with little bearing on reality. While this
can be an advantage at times[^0], these boundless resources can easily keep your
wheels spinning in place. **It's known that adding constraints makes broad
problems easier to tackle.** In the same way, filling limited calendar slots
with scheduled articles, forced my brain to see that there's a limit to the amount of
content I can produce in a month[^1].

In this case, **the limited space on the calendar forced me to ask the question:
_what does truly matter to people out there?_** What can I write in these
limited slots that will make each of them count? What will resonate with those
whose support I seek, and what do the people I work with need to know that only
I can tell them? Once you recognize the boundaries of your time, it becomes
easier to make _choices_ about how to use it. And while I can't say I'm good at
answering these questions, I'm glad I'm learning to ask them.

This experience also gave me a new appreciation for the practical skills
required to create content for a living. People often wear the badge of "bad at
socials" with pride, as if it were an immutable characteristic of their being.
However, **once you see creating content as _choosing_ what's worth your time
and energy, it becomes a trainable skill rooted in empathy.** Deliberate,
thoughtful content production can pave the way to genuine connection and
dialogue. Every article is an excuse to start a conversation with a broader
community, and to engage with them through new knowledge or perspectives on
topics they care about. Becoming a "content creator" is moving from making
content _at_ people to making content _for_ them.

### I wrote some useful things and got some good software done

At this stage, my job _is_ to make content. Whether I like it or not, writing
useful software or plotting brilliant organization-building plans is secondary
to gaining enough support for that useful software and brilliant
organization-building plans to _effectively matter_. "Build it and they will
come" is wishful thinking. **"Tell them about it often enough, and they might
show up, maybe, one day" just doesn't have the same ring to it.**

Among the things that kept me from making content a priority is that I am (by
all reasonable metrics) _just too busy_ for it. However, once I accepted this is
my life right now, I was able to, as they[^2] say, _"bait two seme with one
uke"_. **By positioning my content at the intersection of "what's useful to our
goals" and "what supporters outside might care about", I was able to work on
things I felt _truly mattered_**, like [putting an ambitious plan
into linear
words](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts/enter-the-fujoverse) [^3],
showing beginners [they can aspire to more than simple
websites](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts/html-css-what-next) [^4], or
educating people on [topics they're unlikely to seek out on their
own](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts/extravaganzas/2-2-llc-vs-nonprofit).

Similarly, maintaining a streaming schedule allowed me to make progress on the
software I need to build, while teaching people to build theirs at the same
time. **Nothing says "what you're doing makes a difference" like seeing a
used-to-be-beginner put together concepts they learned through "listening
osmosis"**, and realize they now understand web development at a deeper lever
than they ever thought possible. While my challenges in empathizing with
beginners as someone who's been writing software for twenty+ years are a
rightfully-recurring joke, building software in public had (and will continue
to have) an impact that goes beyond the code itself [^4_5].

### I survived! (somehow)

Aside from the crushing abyss of a blank page to fill (which strict deadlines
help me get over), **my least favorite part of creating content is dealing with
the _perceived_ sense of rejection from putting it out there and getting little
practical interaction back.** This is a struggle for everyone (especially with
social media as it exists now), and I hesitate to say I have it worse than
others here. However, it _definitely_ impacts me more than I wished it did.

What's helping me get over it, aside from inoculation through repeated practice,
is understanding that **content production behaves like compound interests[^5],
and "money"–or, in my case, ["Patreon support"](/support-me#donate)–is a lagging indicator[^6] of
doing a good job at it.**

  emotional turmoil of producing content is to keep producing more of it.

</figure>

While some days of publishing still feel better than others (and likely always
will), I believe this will get better with time. After all, I can point to many
aspects of building communities and leading projects that I can easily juggle
now, but that used to be a great source of stress just a few years ago [^6_5].

**Regardless of how my feelings about content will evolve, however, what matters
is "I survived January 2024".**

_One month down, eleven more to go._

## The bad

### Social media is broken

Proclaiming that "social media is broken" has always been a surefire way to
gather accolades for stating the obvious. However, the experience of producing
_real_ content made me appreciate it to a whole new level. Years ago, I used to
be able to "casually shitpost" my way to engagement; these days, **the landscape
feels so bleak that my desire to shitpost is nowhere to be found, and getting
engagement on more serious content has become an Herculean task.**

In part, this is due to the history of the specific community that I'm trying to
reach (that is, "transformative fandom"). First, Tumblr's demise [^7] scattered
us to _"more nipple-y"_ social pastures; then, Twitter's current "whatever that
is" gave us all the final stab. **How can I reach people where they're at, if
"where they're at" is _everywhere_ and at the same time _nowhere_?** "Casual
shitposting" just doesn't feel as casual when you have to do it across _four
different socials_.

Don't get me wrong: I'm the first one to say that _less people_ on _more
platforms_ is great. However, it's clear that technology has yet to catch up
with the current situation, and **it's harder and harder for people to find
community within this scattered and often hostile landscape**. When you don't
have a community, it's harder to feel your interactions with others matter, and
the resulting isolation acts as a downward pull that makes further interaction
even less likely.**Many of us did not replace the social networks we lost with
new social networks.** Instead, we replaced them with Discord servers (where
communities can still be built) and, when we go back to these platforms, with a
quick, often-mindless catch up that leaves little space for meaningful
interaction.

With the complaining out of the way, however, I'm sure that **the lack of
engagement is partly my own _"skill issue"_**. Trying to understand how creators
engage others on these platforms also made the "necessary grifting
(affectionate)"[^8] stand out more, and, once again, gave me a new appreciation
for its nuances.

<figure>

![](./our-blessed-their-barbarous.png)

<figcaption>
  I know this is not the exact semantic of the meme, but it does convey the
  mindset shift I'm having to do about "professional content creation".
</figcaption>

</figure>

**There is an art to growing a public in the current online world that I'm still
trying to square with my own personality and priorities.** While I believe it is
possible to do this in a way that's aligned to my own ethics, part of
discovering it is unlearning a cultural mistrust of "those who want to build a
public and their dirty tricks".

### One must imagine Sisyphus happy

The long story short is that I got sick for a couple of days a week ago, and my
precious content schedule has been in disarray ever since. This post is late,
the one scheduled for last week has been completely abandoned, and despite all
this I still feel like I'm playing catch up. **Pushing a boulder up a hill just
to see it slide back down when you think the end is in sight is an apt metaphor
for content creation,** and this has become my standard response when I'm asked
about my feelings on it all[^8_5].

In the past, when I worked closely with people who worked closely with
"influencers", I often heard stories of burnout laying just below the surface.
Too many platforms to manage, the inability to stop under threat of newfound
irrelevance, and the risk of parasocial relationships always looming made me
wonder why would anyone even _want_ to do this. If I hadn't been forced into this
position by my desire to change the trajectory of the web, I wouldn't be here.
At the same time, "just don't do it then" _would_ also be a loss: **if important
ideas are had in a forest and there's no one there to hear them, do they make an
impact?**

With time, I hope my schedule will become more sustainable. After all, one of my
main focuses this year is removing myself as the unfortunate (but until now
necessary) bottleneck of the projects I lead. Hopefully, **I will soon be able
to share the load of communicating the value of what we're building, so I can
kick back and return to shitposting about my blorbos.** That is, after all, what
the internet is _truly_ about.

### "How do you do, fellow people?"

I've mentioned ADHD a couple of times already, and with good reason: nothing
makes me feel the weight of neurodivergence as much as trying to empathize with
what "regular people" care about does. Indeed, **while "masking" and "hyperfixations"
are most often discussed in regards to autism, ADHD people also often share
these traits and the associated diffuculties.** And so, while I've made progress
on aligning what I write with what I believe people want to hear–and I'm glad I
did!–I still struggle with feeling like I even _know_ what that is.

Like they do for many other neurodivergent kids, **the internet and fandom gave
me a space where my encyclopedic knowledge of whatever piece of media I was
fixated on was not seen as _"weird, if not a nuisance"_.** While I could
(attempt to) seem like a professional software engineer in my everyday life,
"online fandom" was the place where I could just _be the way I am_. After all,
my ability to infodump about my latest hyperfixation at 100mph never meant most
people _wanted_ to hear me infodump at 100mph.[^9] That is, unless that infodump
included very–let's call them _"colorful"_–things happening to fictional
characters.

Using my professional "regular person" skills to work on the spaces traditionally
occupied by my neurodivergent self means **I must learn how to
translate between two dimensions that I feel were never meant to touch.** When my current
hyperfixation is reading 500 page business management books, it's hard to engage
the fandom world with _that_. But when I try to talk with "business people"
about my work without fully reverting to a professional persona, I can
feel them smelling the fandom gremlin on me. **In the end, wherever I go, I feel
like I'm straddling two worlds without fully being in either.**

I don't have a solution to this (yet). While I believe one exists, the beaten
path often involves being so good at what you do that people are able to look
past–and in a way _forgive_–your weirdness. While I don't know whether I can
indeed get there, I hope the content I'm writing will help me get these
identities I've always separated just a little bit closer. **If that ever materializes,
I'm sure it will feel good.**

## The practical

With all those words out of the way, it's time for some stats! With such small
numbers it's impossible to know whether anything has any significance, but who doesn't love
seeing some hard numbers anyway?

### $upporters by platform

Here's the $upporters stats for January:

- **Patreon:** +6
- **PayPal:** +1
- **Stripe:** 0

I'm surprised at how much more popular Patreon is compared to my self-hosted option. I assume
you really can't beat convenience. The alternative is I wrote buggy code. Might be both!

### Additional stats

- 3 ko-fi tips
- +17 followers and 2 subscriptions on twitch (for a whooping $5.5 in revenue)
- +20 followers on tumblr (the only platform that tells me about it)

### Content reception

**Most of the new $upporters came from the ["enter the
fujoverse"](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts/enter-the-fujoverse)
article**, which makes sense because it debuted what me and collaborators have
been working towards in a package finally understandable enough to support.
Another small bump also came after the ["LLCs vs
nonprofits"](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts/extravaganzas/2-2-llc-vs-nonprofit)
article, which received little overall engagement but a lot of positive feedback
by those who did read it (tl;dr: "I learned things I didn't know I wanted to learn").

**A good percentage of $upporters came from people personally reccommending my
work to others.** If you ever wonder whether your word of mouth matters, the
answer seems to be that it does. A lot.

**My most popular post was ["I made some pages in HTML and CSS, now what?"](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/posts/html-css-what-next).**
I believe the eye-catching title has a lot to do with it. However, compared to the other
two, this article resulted in no new $upporters (at least not directly).

**My most successful stream was _definitely_ "playing around with the Mastodon API".** I guess
decentralization topics are very relevant to the current zeitgeist of people who care
about the same things I do. We'll see if this remains true with [this month's edition
of "decentralization corner"](/posts/24-02-stream-schedule), especially since we're cheating on ActivityPub and
learning @proto instead.

## Final Words

Whether it eventually turns my projects into a viable monetary path or not, I'm
glad I took the plunge and started this experiment in content publishing. **This has
been a learning experience, and hopefully will continue being such in the _eleven
additional months_ I'll be doing this for.** I hope by the time the year is over
producing content will have become second nature, so I can continue reaping
its clear benefits without feeling as much pain.

Until that happens, thank you for being on this journey with me. _Onwards to February!_

    The reason my content is often delivered through flavor-text-heavy slideshows
    is that my thought patterns are very non-linear, which makes unraveling them
    for written long-form a struggle. "Aren't you using these popup notes in a similar
    way though?" Indeed I am, glad you're catching on. `#ADHD`

[^4]:
    I've been trying to die on this hill for a very long time: while there's a
    lot of people reminding beginners that they don't need complex set ups to
    start building with code, we don't have enough people telling them that
    they–_yes, they_–can tame those more complex set ups and build things they
    can't even dream of yet.

[^4_5]:
    This will be even more true once I manage to wrangle the hours of recorded
    content I have, and cut out the parts where I'm explaining useful concepts
    so they can be listened to in isolation. If this is something you'd be interested
    in helping with, [please get in touch](mailto:essential.randomn3ss@gmail.com).

[^5]:
    The more content you accumulate, the more results you see from your overall
    content production. In an environment that's less ephemeral than modern
    socials (like this blog), the content of yesterday continues producing value
    tomorrow, and the results from each piece of content build up on the ones
    created in the past.

[^6]:
    A lagging indicator happens when the results of the work you do _today_
    will only be visible _sometimes in the future_. The hope is that good
    content now will eventually materialize in a sustainable public, even if
    some days this feels like a pipedream.

[^6_5]:
    These range from very simple things like "I can now maintain a calendar"
    to "I'm the queen of cold emails, just watch me cold email the Pope if necessary".

    Eventually, having to understand how to navigate the "attention economy" is
    unfortunate, but necessary. If you have content you want seen, you have to
    work to present it in a way that makes people want to engage with it more
    than other content out there. "Hate the game, not the player" and so on.

[^8_5]:
    The "happy" part of it is important. If I gotta push this boulder up this
    hill for a long time, you better believe I'll figure out how to be happy
    doing so. I'm still pushing up a boulder though.

[^9]:
    If nothing else, having to produce content on a strict schedule has forced
    me to cut back on the length of my blog posts, which is helpful to both me
    and readers. No, seriously, I'm sorry my blog posts used to be that long
    (for both me and readers).
