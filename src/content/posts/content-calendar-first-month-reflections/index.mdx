## Content calendaring: the good, the bad, and the practical

- This month my (forced) focus was getting a sense of content calendaring
- This is because i'm trying to gain exposure

## The good

### I'm better off for it

- I'm better than I was: I understood why I'm writing articles and learned to
  care about the who
- This was necessary for me. I overthink. If I weren't forced to prioritize, I would
  have probably been stuck forever.
- I think people take pride in being bad at socials, but I've grown to appreciate that
  it's a skill like others. People don't owe you support if you don't know how to reach them
  where they're at and speak their language. You can be smart and know about really big and
  complex concepts, but that's not what gets people to donate. Reaching people where they're at
  is a skill to hone.
- Every article is an excuse to start a convo or explain something, and make a genuine connection
  with people. and their needs.

### I survived! (somehow)

- Getting over the crushing weight of rejection and feeling like what you do don't matter.
  Getting better about it.
- We did indeed get some more supporters
- Money is a lagging indicator
- Every day a little better (but you need to do it every day)

### I actually wrote useful things and wrote some good software done

- Great trick like "if i write an article for the terminal this double as fujoguide work"
- Also got things that I had going for a long time
- When I look back at all I did, i'm proud

## The bad

### Social media is very broken

- Social media is broken, everyone being scattered makes getting reach even more
  annoying.
- People are likely on socials less and less, and rather than replacing socials with
  different socials to interact on, they're replacing it with discord servers and
  doing less socials interaction.
- Made the "grifting" more clear, but it also gave me a sense about its necessity

### It's easy to slide back

- One must imagine sysiphus happy was the motto of This
- Got sick for 3 days and my whole schedule was off
- This is the hardest part, because i'm building a base of content, and i don't have a lot
  of it in the backpocket
- Got sick for 2 days and now it's all over the place
- I have a lot of content that's unpolished and a lot uncut streams etc.

### I still feel like i don't understand people

- Can I align what I need to write with what the public likes
- Will this at some point diverge
- Streams are like this, while they're a good chance to teach what I need to do
  is often more advanced
- Maybe that's fine
- Articles are probably a better thing for me, but streams give me the chance to do
  work for real

## The practical

Here's how I fared:

- 6 new members on Patreon (the biggest bit)
- Most of these were during the intro to the FujoVerse, which yeah, explaining what you're doing
  in a less chaotic format that my slides does indeed work
- Other bump was LLC article
- 0 stripe
- 1 new Paypal
- 3 ko-fi tips
- 17 followers and 2 subscriptions on twitch
- $5

- 20 followers on tumblr
- Most popular post was HTML and CSS post
- The LLC one was well received though not as much engagement

## The conclusion

- I'd still rather grow by word of mouth. People boosting the thing with words has had
  the most impact on conversion, and getting traction on socials is just getting harder.
- I'm excited to continue having to force myself to do this
- Compound interests is frustrating at first but it will pay off
- This website is indeed a WIP and as I go and do more things (like $upporter comments) it
  will all get better and take form
- Once a socials team is set up, pressure on me will go down, but i still think i'll continue this
  (and not only because it was a new year resolution)
