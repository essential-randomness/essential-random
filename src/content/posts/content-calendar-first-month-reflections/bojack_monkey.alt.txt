A four-panel meme of a cartoon horse lying on the grass and a cartoon monkey
leaning over them. 

Monkey: It gets easier. 

Horse: Huh? 

Monkey: Every day, it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every monday,
tuesday and thursday. Thatâ€™s the hard part. But it does get easier.

"monday, tuesday and thursday" is overlapped over the original text ("day")
