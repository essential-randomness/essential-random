## The future

### How much should I grow

- Concept of minimum viable audience
- 1000 true fans, but maybe because we're poor it's 10k
- Calculations with the usual conversion stuff say it's 25k for the $2.5k a
  month i gave myself for august
- I'm concerned over having to water down positions
- I'd still rather grow by word of mouth. People boosting the thing with words
  has had the most impact on conversion, and getting traction on socials is just
  getting harder.

### Continue experimenting with content balance

Currently I have

- 2x article
- 2x coding
- The extravaganza bits (which i had made a bunch of time ago)

I think engagement needs a bit more, and i'm looking forward to experimenting
with formats like explainer threads and more personal stuff. These are currently
too cumbersome to post across platform but we're workign on it :)

Streaming schedule is:

- decentralization (resulted in the most popular stream)
- $upporters only
- Building in public

There is a bit of a shift from the general explain, for which i think the
recordings (and cutting off of parts will work best). I could actually use help
getting the chapters and finding the tidbits of wisdom in the coding chaos.

### Making this more sustainable

- Once a socials team is set up, pressure on me will go down, but i still think
  i'll continue this (and not only because it was a new year resolution). This
  will make it more sustainable.
- I'm actually excited to learn more from people who do this professionally.
  It's important to recognize when you're out of your depth, but keep the faith
  you can indeed learn.
- Compound interests is frustrating at first but it will pay off
- This website is indeed a WIP and as I go and do more things (like $upporter
  comments) it will all get better and take form
