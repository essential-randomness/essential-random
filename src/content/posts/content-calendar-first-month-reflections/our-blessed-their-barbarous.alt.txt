A comic by Tom Gauld of a medieval scene. Two medieval groups face off across a river. They are practically identical. Their castles and boats and so on are labeled with text, which is edited in this version to read:
Our blessed content (left side) - their barbarous engagement bait (right side)
Our glorious hard-to-find relevant posts (left castle) - their wicked SEO (right castle, almost identical to the left castle)
Our great indiscernible content value - their primitive eye-catching thumbnails
Our noble not engaging with whatâ€™s relevant - their backward exploiting current trends
Our heroic producing content for noble motives - their brutish seeking engagement
