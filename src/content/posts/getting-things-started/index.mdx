## The Preamble

Hello and welcome to the first edition of this newsletter! :bobaparty:
Your invaluable support helps me offset development costs, so I can take care of
menial tasks like **"producing the documentation needed to ensure this project
can succeed"**.

Going quick, cause I have to get back to `f i n a l l y` coding Boba.

## Keeping up with Ms. Boba

As you very well know, **we're recently announced Realms, also upping our
support channels to 3** ([newsletter](https://essentialrandomness.com/),
[store](https://store.bobaboard.com) and
[RobinBoob](https://robinboob.com)). This effort took more than a
month.

I can't wait to code again. :bobatwt:

Before that, however, I had a couple things to tie up:

### The Newsletter Survey

We have a "topic of the month" survey to figure out what my target audience
(you) wants. Of course, I'm not going to do this manually. Instead, **I set up a
whole fancy pipeline** to automatically take care of the logistics.

One step further: [I documented it all on my own technical
blog](https://dev.to/essentialrandom/sending-subscribers-surveys-with-ghost-pipedream-and-airtable-569i),
dug up from its grave for the occasion. May this be the first of many
documentations to come!

### Privacy Concerns

As someone warned me (thank you!), [the blogging software I'm
using](https://ghost.org) is taking member names from Stripe despite me having
disabled them completely in the signup. I've opened [a support
ticket](https://forum.ghost.org/t/enable-not-saving-members-name-from-stripe/23874/2)
to get it resolved. In the meantime, as you can read there, I did some code
magic and hacked away the behavior.

If this is a concern for you, **you can remove your name from [the account
settings page](https://essentialrandomness.com/account/).** Sorry about the
issue! I do have a rant about how needlessly hard it is to not have other
people's names leaked to you when running an online business, which might find
its way here at some point.

### What's next for Boba

Now that I can go back to what people are supposedly paying me for, I need to
resist the urge to just _code code code_. No one more than me wants to put their
head down and whip up Realms in a month, but that will just make it harder and
harder for others to help me out in the future. **If we go too quickly now,
we'll pay the price later.**

So here's a rundown of the focus areas I will need to untangle and fit into a
_\~coherent plan~_:

1.  **Performance:** we definitely aren't where I want us to be, especially in
    longer threads. While some of it will be solved on its own once [React
    Concurrent
    Mode](https://reactjs.org/blog/2021/06/08/the-plan-for-react-18.html)
    launches, there's some work that needs to be done regardless (e.g.
    lazy-loading of embeds, serving smaller images, swapping gifs for videos\*).
2.  **Quality of Life Improvements:** somewhat related to performance, but not
    only. For example, _there's definitely something going on with random 500
    errors_. Of course, I can look at the logs and solve these (and I will), but
    I _really_ need better instrumentation so I don't have to wait for people to
    complain before I act. **This is likely to be one of the first things I'll
    focus on in the coming week.**
3.  **Design Work:** "design twice/code once" sort of efforts. For example,
    there's a lot we need to fit in those thread/board sidebars, and I'd rather
    have a path charted before I start incrementally coding improvements. How do
    we collaboratively work on the final result? How do I empower people to do
    this work without me? That's part of the challenge that needs solving.
4.  **Documentation:** stabilizing Boba for Realms is a perfect occasion to
    write documentation and help volunteers do meaningful, impactful work
    autonomously. And documentation is also the perfect chance to standardize
    conventions and kick down some [technical
    debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt). For example, I'm
    looking into adding [OpenAPI-based
    specs](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/start-here.html) to Boba's
    backend endpoints.
5.  **Current Hotspots:** working on more Realms doesn't mean the single ones
    don't also need some love: from better support for deep threads, to search,
    to crossposting, to accessibility, to... _a lot of small things_, "the work
    must go on".
6.  **Realms, of course:** there's a couple different ways I'm planning to
    approach this. In the short term:

    - **Admin Tools:** Realm admins will need to make new boards, new roles, new
      identities... all things I've been doing directly through the DB. No more:
      it's time to get us some nice UI.  
      _\[BobaLore: the 4/20 "decoration settings" page was prioritized knowing
      we'd need the work for Realms\]_.
    - **API work:** All our server requests have, until now, not carried any
      information about the Realm they originated from (understandably, since
      there was only one). I'll need to go through each of them and add this
      information, which is also a great chance for the _documentation_ work
      highlighted above.
    - **Backend Modularization:** does this user have permission to make this
      post? Which set of identities should we select from when assigning a new
      one? These checks, which are already happening, will be based on more and
      more complex logic as time goes on. Some good architecture design done
      now, will save pain later.

    These aside, the _design work_ mentioned above will also feature some
    realms-based effort, like the "eagle eye view"/"welcome page"/"rules
    explanation" flow & screens.

7.  **Code Candy:** those things that make my code worth coding even though they
    might not be the "highest priority". Right now, "emojis", "user badges",
    "realm user pages".

...and that's... _a lot_. Please do let me know if you have thoughts, either
with the [usual anonymous
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewrGG-34xIgMPm89RLFOokincwAIEfpSh9ho19EGLJOJWTtA/viewform),
or [by emailing me](mailto:ms.boba@bobaboard.com), or on Discord, or in any way
you can think of. If you're interested in more (or less) details, you can let me
know through the survey. _wink wink_ :bobaeyes::bobaeyes::bobaeyes:

## From Ms. Boba's Calendar

I'm going to have a bunch of meetings with prospect volunteers, stakeholders,
and random people in the following weeks, but here's the coolest one: I've been
introduced to [Zulip](https://zulip.com/)'s CEO, and will have the chance to ask
him about how to foster a good open source collaboration environment (especially
in these early stages). From their main page:

> Zulip has a significantly larger and more active development community than
> other modern open source group chat solutions like Mattermost, Rocket.Chat,
> and matrix.org.

What's the secret? I don't know. I'll report back with thoughts.

## Final Notes

...and with this, we're done for the first super quick edition! If you
subscribed to this newsletter, you should have received the survey by now. If
you haven't, [let me
know!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewrGG-34xIgMPm89RLFOokincwAIEfpSh9ho19EGLJOJWTtA/viewform)

## See you soon!

### \* Re: gifs vs videos

I expect people to have a knee-jerk _"no!! I hate videos in place of gifs!"_
reaction. I'm right there with you. But there's 2 main reasons this is needed:

1.  **Gifs are really much, much slower to load than videos.** Any web
    performance guide hammers this point down.
2.  Gifs can't be paused, and **I need to be able to pause gifs for
    accessibility reasons**.

Personally, I find not being able to save videos as gifs frustrating, so that's
one thing I'm going to make sure can still happen. If you have other particular
frustrations, do voice them and I'll look into it. This change isn't going to
happen overnight anyway, cause it's a non-trivial addition to the Boba backend
architecture.

### Note: Who has access to this?

**\[UPDATE\]: This is now publicly available!**

For these first editions, I'm currently surveying and giving immediate content
access to both paying and free members (but not the public, which will likely
get it ~3-4 weeks after release). Paid members will still get "stronger dibs" on
the topics. I know who you are.

In the future, this will likely change. I'm also looking at other offerings that
might entice people to give some extra support. All this aside, the most
important offering is **"Boba keeps getting worked on and Ms. Boba cam afford to
hire help so she doesn't crash and burn"**. If you can, consider [becoming a
paid member](https://essentialrandomness.com/subscribe/). If you can't,
[consider letting me know what's stopping
you](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewrGG-34xIgMPm89RLFOokincwAIEfpSh9ho19EGLJOJWTtA/viewform).
