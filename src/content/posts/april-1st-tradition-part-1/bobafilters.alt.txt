BobaBoard's first April 1st joke in action. Introducing Bobafilters, the
ultimate image filters experience for the modern shitposter. A button invites
the viewer to learn more. A demo of the Bobafilters experience shows four
friends huddled together for a group photo; their actual faces are out of focus,
and in the foreground (on the photographer's phone screen) we can see that Misha
Collins' infamous "Mishapocalypse" expression has been masterfully applied atop
all four figures' faces.
