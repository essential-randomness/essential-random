It's official: we're now in the very final stretches of delivering the preview of Issue 1 of
[FujoGuide](https://www.fujoweb.dev) to our Kickstarter Backers. By the time October rolls out
we may even be _truly_ done with it. **What happens on streams next? We have no idea!**

As is now tradition (although one we hope to break soon), the subject of these streams is a bit uncertain
as we haven't regrouped to decide our post-FujoGuide priorities yet. Most likely, we'll work on [Astrolabe
(our fandom editor)](https://github.com/fujowebdev/astrolabe) and continue setting the FujoVerse up for
success!
