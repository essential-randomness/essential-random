Let's talk about this blog.

Something clicked recently, when Mastodon's `rel=me` feature forced me to conceptualize this as my "experimental" blog, thus
leading by the shocking—_shocking_, I say!—realization that it is indeed such. Indeed (as you might notice by half-baked features,
links leading to nowhere, and mostly unfilled project entries), I'm leaving trails for myself of knicks and knacks to
explore with time.

## The why

In short, the reason I'm building this blog is that there I believe there is a perfect storm brewing.
For the first time in history, technology is coming out to make the Dream started by the IndieWeb finally not
just possible, but accessible and customizable.

In short: for a _there is a great, new type of modern website engine_
just waiting to to be born, _just out of my reach_. In a way, this blog is my attempt to carve out "the solution" out of
a mishmash of the pieces that other people have seen and worked on. Part of my 2022 is going to be exploring how to make what you see here all fit together, and hopefully sharing
some of the building block I'll inevitably build with all of you.

## The goals

1. Act as a "command center" for your existence on the web: there is a lot of interesting microdata that you
   might want to propagate about you on the web, and it's kinda telling that we let link.tree be so popular.
2. Be born _from_ your content, not be the source of it: a blog should be a layer on top of things you can
   port around the web.'
3. Propagate metadata to other website, and have everything be scrapable and targetable
4. Be easily modifiable at the level someone wants it to be modifiable at. It should never be harder than
   it can be. Everything should be customizable in a way that's shareable.
5. Be easily deployable, with no compromises.

Somewhere there is also this diagram here, and the fact that I have bought the `shrines.club` domain.

## The tech stack in place

### MDX

[meme: shut up about mdx shut up about mdx]

If you haven't heard me rant about how good MDX is, consider yourself lucky. Here's the downlow: MDX
is _really, really_ good.

#### UnifiedJS

My love for MDX is inseperable from my love for the unifiedjs ecosystem (and their organizational structure).

UnifiedJS allows you to apply plugins to stuff. For example, here's some plugins I could add (and whether I added)

- [x] Github-flavored markdwon, allowing me to ~~strike through~~ things, and
- [x] Automatically adiding header links to my things
- [ ] Some TOC thing, though I haven't found the perfecrt one yet. Will have to write a plugin.
- [ ] A plugin I've actually been writing, to reimplement a more flexible version of docusaurs notes.

### ContentLayer

I have been somewhat disappointed with the development experience of content layer, and can't really reccommend it
as wholeheartidly as i wish i could, but i still find the idea to be just wha'ts needed. It does two main things:

1. Puts the content in its own folders, and compiles it for you before serving
2. Applies the MDX plugins
3. Makes it easy for you to import the content where you want

Problems:

- [ ] Images are separated from the source
- [ ] Not as fine-grained as I'd like (hard to add plugins only to specific things, for example)
- [ ] Should rely on more portable things like Zod

### NextJS (most likely axed for Astro, _possibly_ Remix)

Right now, this is using NextJS 13. Big reason: NextJS is what Boba is written in, and i've been dying to fix some
problems that NextJS version 13 would. So I've been using it for it.

But I think NextJS is a bit too much for what I want to write here: I don't want enterprise software, and I am actually
tempted to even go as far as Astro. If nothing else, I'm going to

#### Straight up vanilla CSS

### Payments that I own

## The tech stack to come

### TODO: ActivityPub & RSS & other microformats

### TODO: NixOS

This will allow me to also explore other stuff, like adding image services, my own "iframely"
implementation (I'll rant about iframely another time).

### The final frontier: Netlify CMS

Sometimes you have a good idea and then realize someone else has done it. That's me with netlify CMS.
