We're officially back on air! The next two months (or, better said, the next
month-and-a-half), will be a bit different: since we're focused on making as
much progress as we can on our two fundraising campaign
([FujoGuide's](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/essential-randomness/the-fujoshi-guide-to-web-development)
and [FujoCoded's](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/fujocoded-llc/fujocoded-software-and-education-for-a-better-web)),
we're reducing our streaming schedule to just once a week.

This schedule is _very_ subject to last-minute changes. For the most part, we'll
do whatever work is most relevant to the task at hand as we fulfill our campaign
promises.
