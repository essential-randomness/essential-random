Slide 4. On the right of the slide is a big circle with three rings inside. The first ring is dark grey, and approximately 30% of the circle, the middle ring is light grey and approximately 50% of the circle, and the center is even lighter grey with a yellow lemon with a bite out of it, which is about 30% of the circle. On the left hand side of the slide, from top to bottom: 

Fanworks Fandom. Fanart, fanfics, cosplay, and other "fanworks" with a line pointing to the outer ring of the circle.
Shipping Fandom. Focus on fictional relationships(ships is in italics) with a line pointing to the middle ring of the circle.
Fujin. That's us! with a line pointing to the center ring of the circle with the lemon.
