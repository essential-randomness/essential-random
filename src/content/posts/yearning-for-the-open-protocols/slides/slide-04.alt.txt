Slide 4: Same slide as slide 3, but now the image below is the FujoCoded logo with the lemon with a bite taken out of it in neon yellow. FujoCoded is in pink, with Fujo bolded. LLC is in blue right next to it. Below, green monospaced terminal font opens with the right caret and reads" Empowering fujoshi and other online subcultures to shape their web through software, education, and community collaboration. Below that, in the same font but white, reads: Since 2024.
