Selective data dump for fan statisticians

Published: 2021-03-21 21:35:00 UTC Tags: 2021, site stats

From time to time, we get contacted by students, scholars, and people interested
in fandom stats who would like to access information about the fanworks in the
AO3 database, such as frequently used tags or growth of a fandom over time.
While we're unable to respond to individual requests, today we're pleased to
provide a one-time release of data for all of our users.
