  <summary>OwO What's this?</summary>

This is a commented version of the first edition of my $upporters
newsletter/town hall/"quarterly extravaganza". It was originally published in
July 2023, and I'm only now (December 2023) getting to making it public. If you
want new editions of this Town Hall straight into your inbox as soon as they're
available, you can support me on

## Intro: This "Town Hall"

Fashionably late (or, better said, just in time for the second one), it's time
to finally release my first $upporters-only Town Hall to the world, "...and Now
It's Time to Find Out" edition!

Follow along this blog post to learn more about the BobaVerse (including what it
is)... but first, some context!

![file:./slide-1.alt.txt](./slide-1.png)

### About "Town Halls"

For the uninitiated to the intricacies of "corp speak" a Town Hall is a meeting
where leaders answer questions and share plans with everyone. My own flavor of
Town Halls ("Quarterly Extravaganzas") are sent ~quarterly to my paid $upporters
([you can become one
here](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/support-me#donate)).

![file:./slide-2.alt.txt](./slide-2.png)

### Ground Rules

Before we dive in, something incredibly important to me (and hopefully to you
too): ground rules. While some don't apply at the public stage, others (like the
"trade offer") remain relevant. I strive to be open, honest, and accountable,
but I can only be in a mutually-respectful and psychologically safe environment!

![file:./slide-3.alt.txt](./slide-3.png)

### Getting Started (Finally)

With this out of the way, then welcome to the first public edition of "Ms Boba's
Quarterly Extravaganza", aptly named "and Now It's Time to Find Out".

![file:./slide-4.alt.txt](./slide-4.png)

## Part 1: What is The BobaVerse™?

![file:./slide-5.alt.txt](./slide-5.png)

### The BobaVerse™

As the slides say, "the BobaVerse™ is an eclectic collection of projects related
to coding, community and fandom on the web that may or may not create a
sustainable ecosystem one day". We took all we learned while [building up the
BobaBoard project and community](/projects/bobaboard), and charter the path to a
future where members of online niche communities participate in the creation of
both spaces and software!

![file:./slide-6.alt.txt](./slide-6.png)
![file:./slide-7.alt.txt](./slide-7.png)

### Building it Slow

Getting any project to sustainability is hard, but getting a project off the
ground in this online (and fandom) environment is a particularly thorny issue!
Doing it slowly is fundamental to success, but doing it slowly is not easy,
either! Many issues loom on the horizon.

![file:./slide-8.alt.txt](./slide-8.png)
![file:./slide-9.alt.txt](./slide-9.png)

### A Different Approach

Given the complexities of building sustainable community-driven software, The
BobaVerse™ wants to do things differently: rather than just building another
unsustainable social platform with disenfranchised users, it seeks a
self-sustaining ecosystem that involves them in the building process (and helps
get more underrepresented people into Open Source at the same time)!

![file:./slide-10.alt.txt](./slide-10.png)
![file:./slide-11.alt.txt](./slide-11.png)

## Part 2: Where is The BobaVerse™ at?

(or better said, "where was the BobaVerse at in July 2023, when this was
written?")

![file:./slide-12.alt.txt](./slide-12.png)

### The Fundamental Question

While a vision like this poses a lot of questions, the most important one is
also simple: can this all be set up for success before I run out of money and
have to go back to sell my <abbr title="Over Powered">OP</abbr>
programming/marketing skills to some <abbr title="Venture
Capital">VC</abbr>-backed company?

![file:./slide-13.alt.txt](./slide-13.png)

### Learning, Failing, and Back to Learning

The process of getting to sustainably build things is a treacherous and complex
one, one that must account for the (unfortunately inevitable) failures along the
way. Learning is a fundamental part of the building process!

We fail, we learn, we get up, we go back to trying!

![file:./slide-14.alt.txt](./slide-14.png)
![file:./slide-15.alt.txt](./slide-15.png)
![file:./slide-16.alt.txt](./slide-16.png)

### Our Wins

In more practical fashion, the first half of this year (back in July) saw quite
a few wins under our belt! The highlight is [The Fujoshi Guide to Web
Development](/projects/fujoguide), our successfully Kickstarted guide to Git and
GitHub that will help us clear the highest hurdle to collaboration: teaching
Version Control to a whole new set of people!

![file:./slide-17.alt.txt](./slide-17.png)

### Our Losses

We also had a few Ls, which we don't shy away from! For one, the Kickstarter was
an immense amount of effort (but worth it); I'm incredibly far from covering my
rent (so I can keep at this); and life just Keep Happening™ to both me and
volunteers, which makes collaboration hard!

![file:./slide-18.alt.txt](./slide-18.png)

### How to Help

So how can you help? Well, we did have some requests, and we did get help with a
bunch of them! Right now (for how uncomfortable that is to say) the main thing
we need is recurring income. Our runway is getting shorter, and every little bit
helps us focus on building and not fundraising!

![file:./slide-19.alt.txt](./slide-19.png)

**The most impactful way is to support me directly**, either on
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/essentialrandomness) or on [this same
website](https://www.essentialrandomness.com/support-me). If you can't give
yourself, consider pitching it to friend(s) that want to help build a better
web!

**If you'd rather give one time,** we're running a 2023 holidays fundraiser with
exciting discounts! It won't give you early Town Hall access (unlike patron
support), but you can get sleek Yaoi cheese paddles or Ship Ownership
certificates for you or a friend!

## Bonus: What we Learned Running a Kickstarter Campaign

Since content creation takes a long time (and I need to entice people somehow),
I'm keeping bonus question content as subscribers-only! If you're interested in
reading it, make sure to [subscribe to one of my support channels](/support-me)!
At this stage, you'll also need to ask me for a link, since old editions aren't
automatically sent out (working on it).

...and that is all for this edition of Ms Boba's Quarterly Extravaganza!
