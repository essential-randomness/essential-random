## Town Hall 2 part 2: We (mostly) figured out the legal stuff

Since the dawn of [the BobaVerse project](/posts/enter-the-fujoverse), I had one
question in the back of my mind: **in the long term, should these projects be under a
nonprofit or a more typical business structure?**

For a long while, this question stayed unanswered. Then, after FujoGuide's very succesful
[Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/essential-randomness/the-fujoshi-guide-to-web-development)
showed us we were "in for the long run", it became time to finally answer it.

The challenges were many: for one, I had never worked with lawyers before (not even in my
home country); then, as the lawyers themselves said, "the legal system is 20 years behind
the type of project you're trying to build"; last, (in case you're not aware) lawyers are
_really expensive_.

However, with grit, determination, and lots and lots of reading, we eventually made
a choice.

Here's what we learned.

![file:./slide-1.alt.txt](./slide-1.png)

### Nonprofits vs LLCs

The first step in this journey was to **look at the path chosen by other
fandom-adjacent entities.** As people might know, [Archive of Our
Own](https://archiveofourown.org/) (the largest fanfic archive, popularly known
as AO3) is headed by T[he Organization for Transformative
Works](https://www.transformativeworks.org/), a _nonprofit_ organization
dedicated to the preservation of fanworks. Conversely,
[Dreamwidth](https://www.dreamwidth.org/) (a social network for fandom born [on
the wings of
Strikethrough](https://fanlore.org/wiki/Strikethrough_and_Boldthrough)) went
with an LLC, thus choosing the for profit route.

Being unable to copy our foreparent's homework (an unwise choice regardless),
the next task became clear: **we collected information on the difference between
nonprofit organizations and LLCs** to help us determine which one would better fit our
needs.

![file:./slide-2.alt.txt](./slide-2.png)

On the other side of this work, the difference feels straightforward. However,
getting a clear picture of the legal intricacies felt way more overwhelming
when learning about it all. This is just an abridged version of them!

> Fun fact: **we were sure we'd make the opposite choice until the
> almost-very-last minute.** One day, you'll hear all about what we'd do if we
> had the resources to choose both (maybe one day we will).

### Choosing a Winner

As the slide below says in big, bold letters, **we chose to incorporate\* as an
LLC** (and, once we grow enough, possibly switch to a benefits corporation[^1]).
This was not an easy choice, and we went back and forth–and agonized over it–for
quite a while. Eventually, however, a few considerations tipped the scales:

1. While our projects have a "charitable intent" that would allow us to qualify
   for 501c3 status (a.k.a. become a nonprofit), we decided that **the procedures
   required would place a too heavy weight on our already-stretched shoulders.**
2. As we're spearhead many ambitious projects with very little budget, **we
   wanted to be able to reward those who took a bet on us with their time and
   work**, should our efforts eventually pay off.
3. Last–_without mincing words_–**the online (and fandom) discourse around and
   view of nonprofits made us uncomfortable**: while it's true that nonprofits
   have a charitable intent, they still have a balance sheet to balance, and
   produce work that deserves to be paid for. This seemed too easy to forget.

> \* As of January 2024, we're not yet officially a company. We're working on it, and you'll
> hear more as the year progresses!

### The ethical concerns

Given that our projects have a clear "anti-corporate bent", becoming a for
profit corporation came with concerns. As we researched more, however, we
found that **LLCs are an incredibly-flexible legal structure** with ample power to
add ethical guardrails. By adding to their Operating Agreements (the governing
document of an LLCs), **the members of an LLC can ensure the company is run
(and remains run!) in a way that's consistent with their values.**

The scope of available options for a custom operating agreement (and, most
importantly, _their consequences_) is a deep rabbit hole we haven't fully dived
into _yet_. Among [the possibilities we learned
about](https://youtu.be/5DTQinOmuEU?t=1832&si=X2lKNKafSx1RMJu3) is putting a
legal upper limit on the amount of returns that can be offered to investors
(thus discouraging or outright forbidding Venture Capital investments); ban the
company from being sold to corporate entities; or become a cooperative managed
by its members, or even a custom type of management structure that better meets
the needs and wishes of our collaborators.

![file:./slide-4.alt.txt](./slide-4.png)

Until we have more resources in place and a better understanding of our future,
we're going to keep things simple: at first, our LLC will be what's called a
"single-member LLC", owned by yours truly (me). As our work continues and
enjoys more and more stability (and more funds for lawyers), we'll be
looking into **how we can better distribute both success and responsibilites, as well
as how to formalize and incorporate our ethical principles.**

> In the meantime, **if you know a lawyer who loves infodumping about corporate
> (or other) law (especially on Discord), [please send them my
> way](mailto:essential.randomn3ss@gmail.com).** Our legal journey has just
> started, and it's only going to get more complex from here on out.

While I condensed it in just 3 slides, this research has taken a lot of time,
effort, and money. Lawyers are a significant expense. **We really, _truly_
wouldn't have been able to get here without the pro-bono help of the amazing
["Sustainable Economies Law Center"](https://www.theselc.org/mission)**, whose
lawyers provided incredible advice and fielded many disparate questions. [You
can donate to them here](https://www.theselc.org/give).

### For-profit motives and social networks: BobaBoard's destiny

If you asked me about the corporate structure of BobaBoard in the past, you've
undoubtely heard **my rant on the incompatibility of for-profit motives, and
sustainable, community-driven social networks.** While this might make the
choice of going with an LLC appear puzzling, I want to assure you: my opinion on the
topic has not changed.

While we'll move many of [the projects in the
~~Boba~~FujoVerse](/posts/enter-the-fujoverse) under the new legal entity,
**BobaBoard will stay behind as an independent project.** We're currently
looking into [fiscal hosting](https://opencollective.com/fiscal-hosting) as a
lightweight option to grant it nonprofit status, without adding an unsustainable
administrative burden. Once again, you'll hear more as the year progresses.

[^1]:
    A benefits corporation is a new type of legal structure that sits in-between
    nonprofits and other corporate structures like LLCs. **A benefits corporation
    must include a social benefits cause in its mission statement, and must
    consider the social impact of its business choices**, rather than just the
    economic impact for its shareholders. While complications with taxes and
    processes make it an unwise choice to start with, we'll continue evaluating
    the possibility with time.
