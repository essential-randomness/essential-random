Another slide, talking about the misconception that LLCs are The Bad Corporations and what they actually are. Full text follows.

Aren’t LLCs = The Bad Corporations (trademark symbol)?

LLCs are mostly about creating a legal entity to protect the assets of the person(s) who owns the company (LLCs can be co-ops, workers-owned, etc…)

On the side: for example: if an LLC gets sued, only the company money is at risk (rather than e.g. my house)
(not that I have one)
(hashtag millennial)

Back to bullet points:
As an incredibly flexible legal structure, LLCs can set up guardrails to make sure that they can’t e.g. unilaterally be sold to another corporation (which is a significant source of our modern problems)
Similarly, there can be restrictions in place on e.g. what the business is allowed to offer to investors

On the side:
so you could make it legally impossible to e.g. accept VC funding, even in the future (for example by capping maximum returns)

Last bullet point:
Also, new legal structures like benefit corporations can have explicit goals of doing good for the world alongside protecting shareholders

Underneath this last bullet point:
TBH what I found here is that people choose to structure their LLCs to enable unethical behavior, rather than “ethical LLCs” being impossible
On one hand, “unsurprising”, on the other hand pls understand I knew nothing about US business law a few months ago

Concluding note:
All this is regulated by the LLC’s “operating agreement” (we’ll start with a standard one while we study the various options) (the trials and tribulations of too much flexibility tbh)

In a bottom corner:
big thanks to the “Sustainable Economies Law Center” for their excellent material and free help (link: go donate) (literally couldn’t have done it without them, lawyer costs are pwning our funds lmao)
