Another slide, talking about why LLC was chosen. Full text follows:

And our winner is… LLC! (or a fancy alternative like a benefits corporation)

In a top corner:
(also let it be known I did not give up on the idea of setting up a nonprofit too)
(but not right now)
(right now we gotta fight to get a stable business going)

Listed under the “winner is LLC” heading:
Not enough resources, people, and/or time to go the nonprofit way
Too-strict requirements over profit-sharing make it hard to creatively supplement the little upfront cash we have
And, tbh, a nonprofit would set the wrong expectations

Under that last bullet point:
I do “vibe” with the ideas behind nonprofits, but it’s too easy for people to think “nonprofit” = “works for free” (which isn’t true, btw)
The goal is a company that builds things that are good for the world AND gets paid for them (and it’s already hard to convince people they should pay for software when you’re not “a charity")
Eventually a balance sheet needs balancing, and if people don’t buy what you make, then you don’t have resources to make it (this is true for both legal structures, but a nonprofit makes outsiders more likely to forget this)

On the side: a photo of a “Limited Liability Companies for Dummies” book and a “Nonprofit Kit for Dummies” book
Text underneath: Thanks to whoever rec’d the “for dummies” books in the FFA thread, I need you to know you literally saved my life
I didn’t consider them at all, cause I’m not a dummy
(...except on this I kinda am)
jokes aside they’re genuinely good and informative books
