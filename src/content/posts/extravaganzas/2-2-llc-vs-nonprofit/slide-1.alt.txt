Right side:

Thing that Got Done since Last Quarterly Extravaganza #2:
We (mostly)
figured out
legal stuff 

Left side:

The matrix "I know kung fu" meme, but it reads: i know how to work with lawyers (mostly)

flavor text:
look, I never had to work with lawyers before

now I know more about US business law than my poor European immigrant brain ever wanted to know 

(that is, 0)

Bottom: screenshot of 2 toots reading "lawyer: you're very knowledgeable about these laws / me, as my soul leaves my body: thank you" and "every moment I spent reading about law is one less moment spent reading about my blorbos".
(these are the sacrifices I do for The Causeâ„¢)
