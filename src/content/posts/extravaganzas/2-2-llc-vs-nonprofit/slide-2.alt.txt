A presentation slide comparing nonprofit organizations with limited liability companies. Full text follows:

It’s time to solve a long standing Question™, a.k.a.: “I can be your angle or yuor devil” (but until now, i’ve been your sole proprietor)

On one side:
Nonprofit Organization (fandom example: The OTW)
Has no owner
Cannot distribute profits (e.g. royalties from sales)
Is governed by a board
People can deduct donations from their taxes
It’s a lot of work

On the other side:
Limited Liability Company (fandom example: Dreamwidth)
Can have one or more owners
Can do whatever with their profits
Is governed according to its operating agreement (an incredibly flexible document that describes the financial and functional governance of the LLC)
People cannot deduct donations from their taxes (but they can still donate!)
It’s also lot of work, but significantly less than a nonprofit
