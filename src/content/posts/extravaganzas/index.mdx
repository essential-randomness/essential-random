## What are Quarterly Extravaganzas?

"Quarterly Extravaganza" is **my quarterly(ish) newsletter where I
update my (paid) $upporters on everything that's going on with [my
projects](/projects).** Currently, extravaganzas are delivered as PowerPoint
presentations, with a hefty dose of accompanying small-text commentary that
reflects how my ADHD brain thinks about these topics.

## Are there Ground Rules to these Extravaganzas?

I'm glad you asked! The goal of these extravaganzas is to create a space where
people who support my work can not only be kept up to date, but receive this
information in a way that's authentic, transparent, and holds me accountable for
the choices I make. While this is important to me, however, **it's also
important that people on the other side understand it as a mutual exhange.**
Indeed, this relationship can only flourish in an environment where people
respect who I am, understand the difficult constraints I work under, and trust
that, while I _will_ make mistakes along the way, I'm deeply committed to my
stated ideals.
