Slide 53. An Appeal from Ms Boba. A modified Chick Tract meme. Most people rejected her message. Someone in the hostile crowd shouts Shut up! They hated Ms Boba because she had to fit a complex, nuanced issue within the boundaries of a larger talk. The slide implores, please don't kill me. It is attributed to Galatians 4:20.
