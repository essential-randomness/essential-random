Slide 45. Hierarchy of Skills (perceived), with the notes: I had someone else arrange these, please don't read too much into it. A double arrow labeled Valuable at the top and Useless at the bottom is beside a word cloud of sorts with the following skills, from top (most valuable) to bottom (useless, or so they say): sales, business planning, marketing, managing people, writing business code, writing UI code, UX design, tasks tracking, customer support, data entry, note-taking, social media posting, asking questions, body doubling, alt-text writing. As a bit of trivia, Ms Boba had me (the person writing this alt text) arrange these skills by perceived value. Alt text is crucial, please include it!
