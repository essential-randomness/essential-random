Slide 70. Bibliography. The book covers of five texts referenced within the presentation: Collective Power, Patterns for a Self-Organized Future by Ted J. Rau (multicolor curved lines swirl in a circle behind the subtitle); Many Voices One Song, Shared Power with Sociocracy by Ted J. Rau and Jerry Koch-Gonzalez (multicolor text comprises the title, with gears and stars and other patterns within the otherwise solid fill of the letters); Building Brand Communities, How Organizations Succeed by Creating Belonging by Carrie Melissa Jones and Charles H. Vogl (multicolor hexagons stack like honeycomb to form a structure); The Art of Community, Seven Principles for Belonging by Charles H. Vogl (multicolor strands of string are woven together like a friendship bracelet or some other rope); and Reinventing Organizations, A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness, by Frederic Laloux and with a foreword by Ken Wilber (two blue morpho butterflies land gently next to what seems to be a thin wireless keyboard).
