Slide 16. That Fateful Day, with screenshots of quotes from three recognizable leaders of online platforms. First, Denise Dreamwidth: I have devoted a decade and a half of my life, worked at the absolute limit of my physical capacity even during the worst of my disability issues and even when it's made my disability issues much worse, and sacrificed, at a conservative estimate, approximately $2m in lifetime career earnings, all in order to prove that it's possible for a small group of dedicated people to run social media in an ethical and aboveboard manner that puts users' needs first and refuses to resort to advertising, venture capital, or sacrificing users' privacy. Next, Matt Automattic: No. Some of the hate and vitriol I've experienced running Tumblr has been deleterious to my personal and mental health. This is true of many other staff as well. Finally, Leif Omegle: the stress and expense of this fight coupled with the existing stress and expense of operating Omegle, and fighting its misuse - are simply too much. Operating Omegle is no longer sustainable, financially nor psychologically. Frankly, I don't want to have a heart attack in my 30s.
