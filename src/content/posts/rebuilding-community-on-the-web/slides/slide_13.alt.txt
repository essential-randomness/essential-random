Slide 13. Enter BobaBoard. A screenshot of the BobaBoard website, circa 2020. The color scheme is white text with pink accents upon a black background. The main image is of Boba-tan seated at her desk, browsing AO3 while surrounded by merch of her blorbos. The navigation reads, Open Letter, FUCQs (Formerly Unasked yet Common Questions), About, Updates. The homepage explains Part Forum, Part Social Network, (Mostly) Anonymous. From sensuous LGBT+ romance to the darkest of fanfictions, BobaBoard is the safest way to experience fandom.
