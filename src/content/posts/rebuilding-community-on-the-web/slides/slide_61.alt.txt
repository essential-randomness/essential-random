Slide 61. A poster from Sociocracy For All .org that features four circular tables with varying numbers of people seated at them, all connected (directly or indirectly) by squiggly arrows. Sociocracy: a peer governance system based on consent. Circles = a trusted team of peers. Groups of 4-8 people work together with a defined purpose (aim) and with authority in their domain. Linking = connectors. Links between circles help align circles, help information flow and balance circles with each other. Decisions = consent. Circles set their agreements by consent - if a circle member has objection, the proposal needs to be improved. Feedback. Build in feedback and increase information flow to make incremental improvements a habit. Share information, decentralize power.
