It's (finally) time! A whole year after my CitrusCon talk, and 10 days before my NEXT one, part 1 of "Rebuilding Community on the (fujo)Web" is on my blog!

This talk explores how indie social software projects are set up to fail, and what to do about it.

In the first part of this 4 parts talk, I explore what I called the "Downward Spiral", which traps project runners (and users) in a cycle of burnout, disillusionment, and outsized expectations, which then leads to even more burnout, disillusionment, and outsized expectations.

"Real solutions" will have to wait for the next parts! In the meantime, this part talks about the solutions people want to desperately believe will fix this: doing less, raising more funds, and reducing costs via volunteers recruitment (spoiler: they don't)

If you're tired of seeing good projects fail and want to understand the systemic forces at play, this talk is for you. You can catch it all on YouTube (), or you can read the rest as I publish over the next few days!

See you at CitrusCon with its spiritual successor, one year later!
