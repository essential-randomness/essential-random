It's (finally) time! A year after my CitrusCon24 talk & 10 days before my next, Part 1 of my "Rebuilding Community" series is on my blog.

This part explores why many indie social projects are caught in a "Downward Spiral" of disillusionment and burnout.

What's the "Downward Spiral"?

It's the vicious cycle where project runner burnout, user disillusionment, and impossible expectations feed each other. This makes it harder for the next project to get off the ground, and breeds resentment even within aligned communities. On\&on...

+++

In this first part, I also look at the common "solutions" we desperately want to believe would work, but that are anything but straightforward:

\- Reducing scope (doing less)

\- Raising more funds

\- Relying on volunteers

Featuring: one of my favorite charts ðŸ‘‡as they say, "ouch"

In the next part, we'll explore THE core issue we must fix, one that (once you see it) explains so much of... everything: our relationship to power.

You can watch the full original talk on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFx4XAOnFVE) or follow along as I post the rest in the next days!

See you soon at @CitrusCon for my new talk (and spiritual successor): "Working Together in a Dying World".
