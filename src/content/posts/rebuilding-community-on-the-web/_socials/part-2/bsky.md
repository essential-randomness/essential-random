Rebuilding Community on the (Fujo)Web, pt. 2

This part (my favorite) is all about why "getting help from your community members" is not a straightforward way to exit the Downward Spiral of Indie Projects Burnout.

The answer is "simple": power dynamics

Many Indie Projects start from a desire to flatten the hierarchy of power between platforms and users. Many project runners are uncomfortable with wielding power at all!

But wishing power away is not enough: the US vs THEM always lies in wait, ready to rear its head‚Äîespecially in moments of crisis.

---

Above all, power is not as simple as we make it: while we all understand the power that flows from top to bottom of a hierarchy (power-over), we rarely talk about power that flows FROM the bottom of a hierarchy to the top‚Äîeven though we see it all the time!

Power-under is all around us online.

---

Changing the power dynamics that happen in Indie Projects and our Community Spaces means understanding that it's not enough for people who build them to give away _their_ power, we MUST figure out how to get people to take on the power that's given away.

Reaching shared power requires both sides.

---

The talk (and article) offers counterarguments to the objections we've found our community members raise when called to step into their power. I was anxious to name it, but learned helplessness resonated a lot.

@mmasnick.bsky.social talked about "digital helplessness" recently. This is our enemy.

---

We'll only get out of our technological bind by giving users the tools and knowledge they need to come shape the Indie Social Web in a way that truly feels _theirs_‚Äîflattening the Hierarchy of Power that divides them and platform runners.

This is power-within: knowing YOU can make a difference.

---

Open platforms and protocol can give people a chance to reach power-within by creating affordances to put their skills to use and build things for themselves/their communities. @fujocoded.bsky.social can build knowledge that will carry them through.

But THEY must choose to walk that path.

---

Once again, I invite you to read the talk in full‚ÄîI can only say so much in this small space.

And if you want to help us help "users" step in their own power, follow (and support) @fujocoded.bsky.social, our company dedicated to doing exactly that.

This Saturday, I'm giving the spiritual successor to this talk at @citruscon.bsky.social, "Working Together in a Dying World". If you're a BL fan come to the convention (it's free!), meet new friends, and come listen to it live!

And if you're not a BL fan... maybe it's time to become one üòè
