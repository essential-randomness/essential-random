This was originally a talk given at [the 2024 edition of CitrusCon](https://www.citruscon.com/citrus-con-2024)
to a public of Boys Love media fans—one of the online communities most impacted by the current state
of the web. [Check it out on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFx4XAOnFVE), or read on!

## The P~~ower~~roblem of Together

![file:./slides/slide_57.alt.txt](./slides/slide_57.png)

And with this hopeful message, it’s time for the last big question: is what we
discuss today enough? Well, I’m sorry to say that alas, **harnessing the power of
more helpers is a necessary but insufficient condition to escape the current
situation.**

Here’s the problem:

![file:./slides/slide_58.alt.txt](./slides/slide_58.png)

As you know the larger the cast the higher the number of relationships between
its members. Similarly, **when more than a handful of people come together to work
on a project, complexity increases dramatically.** Every person adds more arrows
to the graph of relationships, and every arrow adds new possibilities for
misunderstandings, missed expectations, someone shipping your NOTP, and
eventually proper conflict.

## Collectively Building for the Collective

![file:./slides/slide_59.alt.txt](./slides/slide_59.png)

Going deep into this would require us to explore trust, psychological safety and
self-responsibility. However, this talk is already long[^1], so I’ll leave you with
just a few thoughts:

As things are now, it’s hard to feel safe and secure in the spaces we
inhabit. **When we feel under constant threat, it’s hard for people to speak up
when needed and to listen when necessary.**

When the collective suspicion, resentment, and pain that results from their
members feeling silenced, disrespected or otherwise unsafe eventually boils
over, organizations often clench up in response. They tighten their ranks,
become less transparent, and attempt to maintain order through increased control
and hierarchy.

![file:./slides/slide_60.alt.txt](./slides/slide_60.png)

But we can create environments where feedback is gladly given and received. We
can teach people the skills to solve their own conflicts from a place of love,
giving them a true sense of responsibility for the words they use and the
environment they create. We can build projects where we collaborate on an even
field despite our differences.

**But creating those spaces starts with understanding that organizations and
communities are messy.** Being together in harmony is the biggest problem
humanity has ever faced[^2], and one we continue to struggle with. Despite what we
may think, building good organizations is not a solved problem with an easy
blueprint to follow.

### About Sociocracy

![file:./slides/slide_61.alt.txt](./slides/slide_61.png)

This has started to change in recent years. At the end of 2023, I learned about
sociocracy, a peer governance system that uses a mechanism of circles and
consent to enable non-hierarchical, decentralized decision making. **A lot of
what I discussed today I only learned thanks to the educational material created
by [Sociocracy for All](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/)**, an organization
that helps other organizations learn about and adopt this system.

![file:./slides/slide_62.alt.txt](./slides/slide_62.png)

### Mo' Problems, mo' Allies

I hope today helped you appreciate that the problems that plague both our web
and our communities are complex and intertwined. No one knows how to fix all of
these problems alone, and not all of them even have a clear solution.

![file:./slides/slide_63.alt.txt](./slides/slide_63.png)

But here’s the good news: **just like we are not alone as people, we are also not
alone as communities.** There’s a lot of groups out there solving the many
problems on the way to a better, more equitable, more communal online and
offline world.

I mentioned [Sociocracy for All](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/) already, but
we also wouldn’t be here without the [Sustainable Economies Law
Center](https://www.theselc.org/), that has given us free legal advice that
helped me go from someone terrified by the American legal system to someone
who’s still terrified by the American legal system but that can understand and
navigate some of the issues it presents.

And in fandom, I would obviously be remiss not to mention the work that
[Dreamwidth](https://www.dreamwidth.org/) did paving the way and that [they
continue to do](https://dw-advocacy.dreamwidth.org/) on both the legal and
platform sides, as well as offering us support and advice as needed. Similarly,
it’s important to recognize the inspiration that the [Organization for
Transformative Works](https://www.transformativeworks.org/) provided as well as
the wisdom its individual members have shared with us.

![file:./slides/slide_64.alt.txt](./slides/slide_64.png)

On a large scale, **true change does not happen by working together as a single
group, but by empowering people to create new ones and work with others on the
problems that matter to _them_**, with their unique power and perspective.

When such a system exists, everyone can find the place where their power can be
put to use in a way that best matches their work style and values. And just as
importantly, **the failure of one project won’t cause the whole system to
collapse, but instead makes us all stronger** by teaching us what we didn’t know
before.[^3]

## Epilogue

![file:./slides/slide_65.alt.txt](./slides/slide_65.png)

And with this our talk comes to a close.

### BobaBoard

![file:./slides/slide_66.alt.txt](./slides/slide_66.png)

In March, some time after “that fateful day”, I [officially stepped down as
BobaBoard’s project
lead](./posts/boba-retro-2023). While I’m
still involved with the project, this gesture explicitly signaled my decision to
renounce the power I had and put BobaBoard’s future in the hands of the
community.

I’m happy to say people gladly stepped in to take on the power I had given up,
and thanks to the hard work of some contributors, **we’re now in the process of
growing BobaBoard as a sociocratic organization.** Progress is slow, the todo list
is ever growing, but we’re working hard to remove me as a bottleneck and
unwillingly-central decision maker and enable people to come help us make
BobaBoard a reality.

### FujoCoded

![file:./slides/slide_67.alt.txt](./slides/slide_67.png)

And then this April[^4], a few other BobaBoard volunteers and I [officially founded
FujoCoded LLC](https://fujocoded.com), with the explicit goal to empower members of online subcultures
to shape their own web and build a kinder, more diverse, more collaborative
internet.

![file:./slides/slide_68.alt.txt](./slides/slide_68.png)

The projects we run are many and varied. They range from teaching people how
build and collaborate on software by using hot fictional versions of programming
languages, to starting communities that help people find support on their coding
journey, to building experimental software like BobaBoard that will give them a
place to come learn and create their own web. You can help us make a difference
[by supporting us on Patreon.](https://www.patreon.com/c/fujocoded/membership)

This new chapter of this story has just started, and there’s no telling where
it’ll end up going: **knowing our next steps doesn’t make the journey an easy
one.**

But I’m excited and eager to continue working on nurturing an internet
that has meant so much to me, alongside the friends who helped make this journey
possible, and the new faces we’ll continue to meet along the way.

## Outro

![file:./slides/slide_69.alt.txt](./slides/slide_69.png)

Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/fujocoded/membership) so we can continue
providing awesome educational resources, and [buy our incredibly cute
merchandise in our store!](https://store.fujocoded.com/)

Thank you!

### Bibliography

While this story is my personal experience, **the analysis of power dynamics at the
core of this presentation takes heavily from the First Chapter of "Collective
Power"** by Ted J. Rau—which like no other before opened my eyes to
"oh, so _this_ is what's going on here". Many Voices One Song has been similarly
inspiring.

    year later](/working-together). You'll get it in blogpost form...at some
    point. For now, read the author notes!

[^2]:
    There's many things I want people to take from this talk, but this one is
    near the top. There is no easy path to people being together in harmony, yet
    there being enough of them to do things that matter.\
    \
    If you try to avoid conflict forever, you're going to have a bad time. If we
    hold each other to the standard of "someone who's doing this rihgt can avoid
    conflict forever", we're also going to have a bad time.\
    \
    Conflict is a constant danger and a sure destination. If you don't end up with
    some conflict, you're probably not harnessing "your full potential"
    (which is fine—you don't owe that to anyone).
