Thank you for asking, anon! As it turns out, you just activated one of my ~~trap
cards~~ special interests. So, time for a story, an infodump, and the public
unveiling of my Extravaganza #4 slides.

## Searching for Wisdom

When I started working on better online spaces, I knew that to tackle a problem
of that size I'd (eventually) need to form an organization to oversee the
effort. Despite being a much more innocent, bright-eyed software engineer whose
experience predominantly came from within large corporations, **I had heard plenty
of horror stories about independent efforts degenerating into a mismanaged mess,
and was determined to figure out how to avoid this happening.** After all, my goal
was to build an organization that would carry forward my ethical principles in a
way I could be–ideally, _remain_–proud of.

My plan was overall straightforward: go very, very slow, find more experienced
people to hound with questions, then, after finding the organizations who are
Doing It Right™, copy their homeworks. After a lot of false starts, however, I
came to a realization: in the overwhelming majority of cases, organizations
haven't _really_ figured out how to solve the problems that come when many
people are working together towards a goal[^0]–no matter how much _everyone_ in
it cares about the goal and wants the effort and organization to succeed.

## The Truth about Organizations

Nowadays, I believe that organization don't start "good" and become
dysfunctional through the incompetence of misguided individuals; instead,
without someone desperately working to remain ahead and pull them out of
inevitable issues, they naturally devolve into chaos. Managing an organization
is a countinuous struggle against the tendency groups of humans have to go
against the best interest of the collective.

Now, I imagine this could come across as a misanthropic position. I don't
believe that's the case. In a perfect world, humans would have their needs met,
their lives stable, and would be taught effective collaboration and collective
governance as they grow up. Instead, we're all operating in a world that's
crumbling around us, while carrying around intergenerational work trauma born
out of a world where people build empires on the shoulders of those below them.

In this situation, even if you want to build the best, most stable organization,
how are you supposed to _know_ how to do it? And even if you set out to be
better at it than most–_more careful, more understanding, more informed_–how are
you supposed to continue doing it while the amount of people bringing their own
baggage in grows, and you find yourself shorter and shorter in time and emotional
energy?

## Looking Beyond the Web

At my most frustrated, I would have almost told you this is an impossible problem
that no one quite knows how to solve. However, by almost accident[^1], I found out
about two different (but similar!) ways to run businesses and organizations that are
currently being researched and popularized:

- **[Teal Organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_organisation),** an
  organizational theory centered on worker autonomy and peer relationships.
- **[Sociocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy),** a theory of
  governance centered on consent and psychological safety.

Now, there's _way too much_ I'd want to infodump on when talking about these
paradigms. However, I'll have to leave that for another article. Instead, I'll
try to give you pointers about where to learn more[^1_5], and attempt to not be
carried away.

### Teal organizations

Teal organizations have been studied by Frederic Laloux, a former McKinsey
partner[^2], for his book [Reinventing
Organizations](https://www.reinventingorganizations.com/). Compared to the books
on Sociocracy (in the next section), "Reinventing Organizations" is targeted
towards a business management public, and it's a 500-page read I struggle to
reccommend to people who aren't used to them. _All of that said_, both this book
and its illustrated version (a lighter read, but still not great), are available
as ["pay what you want"](https://www.reinventingorganizations.com/pay-what-feels-right.html).
So, if you're curious, do consider downloading them and giving a read to the sections that
look interesting, or to the end of chapter summaries. Skip Part 1 and go directly to part 2.

### Sociocracy

While Sociocracy has a deeper history than Teal organizations, I've found out about it
(and got most of my information) from [Sociocracy for All](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/)[^3],
a nonprofit dedicated to promoting sociocracy as a sustainable way of governance. They have
[a lot of different books](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/books/) available,
but here's two I recommend:

- [Many Voices One
  Song](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/many-voices-one-song-2/), a
  "comprehensive manual covering all topics relevant to sociocracy in
  organizations." This is bigger than some of the very small books they have,
  but not huge. While it acts as a manual, it also explains the theory behind
  the governance models it proposes, and it will definitely provoke thoughts and
  provide valuable insights even if read "recreationally".
- [Collective Power](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/collective-power/), a book
  on "effective collective building principles, that highlights unity, power
  sharing, and governance as crucial for impactful change". This is a lot more
  theoretical than the previous book (and much longer), but it's an incredibly
  enlightening exploration of the problems that arise when trying to work collectively,
  and what can be done to lessen them.

You can find the table of content for both books at the link. There are some free
sociocracy resources on their website too, but I haven't personally made use of them[^4].

## Knowing the Path vs Walking the Path

While I'm obviously very happy about having found these systems, I'm always
somewhat nervous about sharing them without caveats. Indeed, while having found
guidance makes the journey _easier_, it doesn't (unfortunately) make it _easy_.
As we move to understand how we can implement these system in the
organization(s) me and my allies are building, the complexity of fitting these
systems within our limitations remains daunting. You cannot simply read a book
and implement it, and there are unique (and less unique) challenges we face that
make this an uphill climb.

Unfortunately, I believe, people are often less charitable with people who try to
do things right and fail, than with people who just

### Issue 0 – Money

Let's get it out of the way: the answer to a lot of "how do we...?" can be
straightforwardly solved by throwing money at the problem. Whether it's hiring
someone who can get things done efficiently and independently, paying for the
help of an expert, or buying classes (or books) for collaborators[^5], money is
a convenient way to make a hard journey easier.

Most importantly, however, money buys _time_. Time to figure things out, time to
try and fail, and time to eventually learn how to succeed.

Without money–_tale as old as time_–progress is harder, slower, and more
brittle.

### Issue 1 – "Unfortunately, as you probably already know, people"

More originally (and yet somewhat still obviously), "the tendency of people to
be, well, _people_" is a huge barrier in creating an organization that works. As
I've touched upon in the beginning, society does not equip us for the inevitable
difficulties of working collectively towards a shared goal.

Even further, the reality of a life under capitalism is incredibly stressful for
everyone involved.Especially with a group that is so heavily full of
neurodivergent, disabled people whose life can becoem chaotic at any minute, and
have often been full of trauma and rejection, it's easy to accidentally step on
each other's toes. And even when no toes have been stepped on, we're still
fallible. We have bad days, we say the wrong thing, we misunderstand. And rifts
take time and energy to heal.

It's impossible to arbitrate all conflicts that happen in a group, unless you
can specifically hire someone trained to do so (which you most likely don't have
money to do). People willing to arbitrate are rarer and rarer these days (they
burn out quickly, and many of us know better by this point). And unfortunately,
people most often don't know how to confront each other, and allow resentment to
brew, or see any confrontation as zero sum conflict.

### Issue 2 – Trust and Psychological Safety

Something that's repeatedly called out by books on both types of organization is
how trust and psychological safety are paramount when it comes to building an
organization that works. This in part relates to what I said before: when people
come in with their own baggage and trauma, it's easy to accidentally trigger
conflict. But beyond that, trust and psychological safety require building
structures and practices that don't come for free, and that require both
emotional work and the ability to sit with and analyze their own discomfort from
everyone involved.

But most of all, trust and psychological safety requires a degree of being
exclusionary with people that don't mesh well with the group's culture and
working style. And the only way we have around this exclusivity impacting the
overall inclusivity of the broader efforts is to have more groups doing work,
and more people leading those groups so the burden of fighting for _everyone_
isn't placed on the effort of a few.

### Issue 3 – Skin in the Game

People have different availability of contributions, different degrees of
energy, and different (and diversely rare[^5_5]) skills that they can bring into any
effort. While it's true that all this intersects with issues of diversity, and
that a fair and just group must be careful to not uncritically bring
capitalistic ideals back into their work, it's also true that not everyone doing
work is doing an equal amount of work (or an equally irreplaceable one[^6]), and is
not as committed and dedicated to the mission at hand.

Eventually, people have different levels of "skin in the game" when it comes to
moving an organization forward. For many reasons, some of us are used to treating
organizations (and the software and projects they build) as a spectator sport,
and believe that as the "customer" or target audience, organizations are beholden
to catering to our own desires. Conversely, others believe that their desires
never matter, and that they have no ability to took issues they care about into
their own hands and champion them to resolution.

People don't know what accountability means, and seek responsibility for
decisions, without responsibility for results.

## The Future and How to help

Having vented my frustration and fear about the future, I want to stress how
grateful I am to have found much better guidance on how to organize something as
ambitious as the organization(s) I'm trying to build [TODO: link to post].
Obviously, it's not going to be just snapping fingers and making it happen. It's
going to be frustrating at times, messy even. But when people deeply understand
and respect this, it becomes easier to work togeether to make these the best
organizations they can be.

It will take a bit before we can open up and welcome more people into our group. A
lot of coordination and work is going on behind the scenes. Once we do, when people
are willing to come in and pitch some help, it's important that they understand that
this is not just fitting into a well-oiled machine, it's _building the machine_ itself,
and be an active participant in the never-ending task of keeping it from breaking.

In the meantime, if you want to help, here's how you can always help:

1. Boost this article on socials. If you can, react to it! Add tags or comments, and
   join in the conversation. Help us bringing this discussion to the larger web.
2. Become an official $upporter on Patreon or on this same website.
3. Follow us to be alerted of opportunities to collaborate on our open source projects,
   or offer feedback on some of our material.

Very excited for the future!

    The pattern generally went like this: Ms Boba, eyes shining bright, finds a new
    organization with an interesting management system . Some time later, some news
    comes out about the organization's internal struggles, and she realize those who she
    thought "got it" don't actually "got it". Rinse, repeat.

[^1]:
    A friend of a consultant I hired recommended me a book on building organizations, and
    I miracolously remembered to actually buy it 3 months after being told about it.
    Take that, ADHD.

[^1_5]:
    If you want to skip the reading and just be reccommended _one_ book, my vote for a
    committed but casual reader goes to [Collective Power](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/collective-power/).

[^2]:
    If you've never heard about McKinsey, John Oliver dedicated [an episode to
    them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiOUojVd6xQ). I mention them here
    because, while I 100% believe amazing people can work for unethical companies
    (and even end up radicalized by the experience), Laloux's line of work explains
    the context he's coming from in his research. Don't let this stop you from reading
    the book and learning more about Teal Orgs though. It's _great_ stuff.

[^3]:
    Funnily enough, I found out about Sociocracy for All from [a
    newsletter](https://enliveningedge.org/browse-topics/) that I found out about
    from resources on Teal Organizations. If this all sounds connected, it's because
    it is. While these are different systems, once you learn about them both,
    similarities start emerging.

[^4]: Clearly you don't need _free resources_ when you have a book-buying problem.
[^5]:
    Both the sociocracy and the teal organizations books call out "training" as
    one of the "must have" requirements for the successful onboarding of employees.
    Among the training they both emphasize is effective conflict resolution, which
    is something I've seen people repeatedly struggle with in our communities, and
    that I wish I had money to train everyone in.

[^5_5]:
    Maybe an unpopular thing to say, but something I struggled with a lot before
    I talked with other people doing this type of work and realized it was not a
    "me" problem: people who can take a nebulous task, and bring it to completion
    without constant handholding at an acceptable level of quality are _incredibly_
    rare. While it's true that not enough people get given opportunity to shine, and
    that capitalism undervalues certain talent, it's also true that _"talent"_
    is in short quantity.

    An important caveat: this doesn't mean that people cannot be taught or trained into
    becoming better at this type of work. A lot of collaborators I've had the pleasure
    to work with have gone from not knowing where to start to incredible project leads.
    But this takes time, energy, and training, and it's notoriously something that (if
    you heed the advice given to startups) you shouldn't do until you have, well, enough
    money to do so. You can see then how this impacts marginalized folks who're less likely
    to be given chances, and why this is by itself a byproduct of discrimination, even
    though we still need to contend with it.

[^6]:
    While it's true that certain people and skills are hard to replace, one must
    make sure that this doesn't become an excuse to compromise on other
    principles. However, the ability to do this also hinges on being able to
    train more people in doing certain work, creating processes around it, and
    being able to hire expertise should someone who was in a crucial position
    need to step down for any reason. Once again, things that are more easily
    solvable with money.
