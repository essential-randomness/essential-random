      Got gifted my first computer and internet connection. Learned HTML (and
      Photoshop!) by building a Neon Genesis Evangelion shrine.

      Skipped a lot of highschool to hole up in my room and build my "fujoshi

      After graduating as valedictorian of her Computer Science degree, I
      emigrated from Europe ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º to Silicon Valley ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ to work for a very large,
      very famous corporation.

      "Got radicalized by the Tumblr porn ban". Or, in better words, realized
      the internet was getting really, really sucky and decided I should do
      something about it.

      abandoned my cozy online anonymity to figure out how to tackle the problem
      from within the web itself.

      Launched a series of projects centered around fandom, tech education, and
      online communities. <a href="/support-me"
