# Techincal & Business Consulting for the Rest of Us

A former FAANG Staff Engineer combining practical founder experience with
Silicon Valley strategy expertise for scaling startups. I'm passionate about
bridging the gap between business, community-building, and engineeringâ€”helping
teams grow sustainable products by balancing their business and technical goals
with those of their users.

Having been on both sides of the table, I understand the challenges of finding
reliable technical partners who can independently own and drive projects
forward. Whether as an individual contributor or as a team lead, I can help you
make confident technical and business decisions, bring new products
and features to market, and grow a sustainable organization.

## Where I Can Help

## Experience That Matters

Here is some blah blah blah about the 3 different things I do

### Founder Perspective

I spent my last 4 years building FujoCoded, an independent small-tech company
bridging technology, education and fandom. As part of this I:

- Built and launched multiple real-world project from concept to production,
  both independently and with a team
- Managed distributed, contractors and volunteers teams across multiple time
  zones and expertise levels
- Successfully raised $27k across two crowdfunding campaigns targeting niche
  markets
- Balanced technical decisions with business constraint with uncommon technical
  and business requirements
- Developed expertise across key business functions including technical
  leadership, strategic planning, team development, and stakeholder
  communications

### Big Tech Experience

I spent 10 years working in FAANG companies, growing from intern to Senior
Engineer by developing and scaling cross-organizational systems for products
used by millions. As part of this I:

- Made high-scale system architecture decisions producing and reviewing highly
  technical design documents
- Developed internal and external infrastructure balancing the needs of multiple
  stakeholders across multiple functions
- Created maintainable, well-documented code spanning frontend, backend, and
  infrastructure development, including large-scale Machine Learning systems
- TODO

### Technical, Business and Community Leadership

TODO.

- Built and mentored remote teams, with an emphasis on growing junior and
  hobbyists developers, guiding them past time and skills constraints
- Developed and implemented multiple roadmaps for ambitious projects
  successfully delivered within a limited timescale and limited resources
- Founded and managed multiple small communities, including a 300-people
  technical community covering hobbyists, student, junior and senior developers
- Currently scaling multiple organizations I founded which include both a
  technology-focusedy business and a technology-related non-profit initiative
- Wrote an accessible guide to Git, GitHub and general Version Control for a
  non-traditional non-technical public
