## Technologies I Know

**I'm extremely knowledgeable about the TypeScript ecosystem, and I've been
leading projects using React, NextJS, React Query, Storybook, and Astro for the
past 5 years.** I love building plugins, and I've done so for Storybook, Vite,
MDX (UnifiedJS), Astro, Jest, Express, Zod and more. I also love integrating software
together, and I've done work with PayPal, Stripe, Discord, social sites
including Twitter and Tumblr, GitHub (including Actions) and others.

**I have experience across the full webdev stack**, including both backend
(Express, PostreSQL, SQLite, Redis, Drizzle, and others), frontend (including
mastery of CSS), and NPM libraries (both utilities and design systems). I love
building libraries on NPM and REST APIs.

I have some experience with system administration, including NixOS and
NGINX.

**I love trying new technologies and working across their boundaries to make
them work together.** Even if I'm not familiar with what you use, I can catch up
to speed quickly.

In my professional career, I've also worked with Python, Java, and C++.
