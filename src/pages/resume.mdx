# Bridging the gap between Community, Tech & Business

I'm a former FAANG Staff Engineer combining practical founder experience,
Silicon Valley expertise, and years of building community on the web. Whether
you're scaling a startup or starting an ambitious project for social good, **I'm
passionate about bridging the gap between business, community-building, and
engineering**â€”helping teams grow sustainable products by balancing their
business and technical goals with those of their users.

Want to work together? **I'm currently available on a project-basis.**
While I can cover a variety of roles, I've been told I'd make an amazing fractional CTO!

## Where I Can Help

After a long stint as an individual contributor, I've left my stable job to
change the face of the web. Since then, **I've been leading two organizations,
lauching multiple Kickstarters, writing books about version control, and programming
ambitious projects** from new social networks, to Astro-based zine creators, to
plugins for (almost) any modern software you can think of! All of this while
**managing teams of volunteers, multiple communities, and even creating strong
brand identities and marketing campaigns.**

If any of this sounds something you could use help with, [schedule a call](https://calendly.com/essentialrandomness/)!

### Project Ownership

Having been on both sides of the table, I understand the challenges of finding
reliable partners who can independently own and drive projects
forward. **Whether as an individual contributor, a team lead, or fractional CTO,
I can help you:**

- Make confident technical and business decisions
- Bring new products and features to market
- Grow a more sustainable organization

**I'm extremely knowledgeable about the TypeScript ecosystem, and I've been
leading projects using React, NextJS, React Query, Storybook, and Astro for the
past 5 years.** I love building plugins, and I've done so for Storybook, Vite,
MDX (UnifiedJS), Astro, Jest, Express, Zod and more. I also love integrating software
together, and I've done work with PayPal, Stripe, Discord, social sites
including Twitter and Tumblr, GitHub (including Actions) and others.

**I have experience across the full webdev stack**, including both backend
(Express, PostreSQL, SQLite, Redis, Drizzle, and others), frontend (including
mastery of CSS), and NPM libraries (both utilities and design systems). I love
building libraries on NPM and REST APIs.

I have some experience with system administration, including NixOS and
NGINX.

**I love trying new technologies and working across their boundaries to make
them work together.** Even if I'm not familiar with what you use, I can catch up
to speed quickly.

In my professional career, I've also worked with Python, Java, and C++.

## Practical Experience

**I've worn many different hats throughout my career.** Here is a
selection of relevant work that shows my breadth of skills and
experience.
