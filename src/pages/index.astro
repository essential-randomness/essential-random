      <h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
      <!-- <p>
        Since I was gifted my first computer in the early 00s, the internet has
        given me an important place of self-expression, connection, and growth.
        What started as skipping school to program websites, eventually became a
        full-fledged software engineering degree, and a cushy job at a famous
        company.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the Tumblr porn ban hit it was a hard wake up call: far from still
        being a place of joy and discovery—one where a weird, neurodivergent kid
        could learn to thrive—the web was slowly being stripped of its soul and
        potential. The big-tech promise "to change the world and make the web
        better" that I had moved across the world for had been an empty lie.
      </p> -->
      <p>
        Since 2019, I've been working on adding marketing and entrepreneurship
        skills to my software engineering background, with the goal to build
        sustainable projects and communities that will make the web a better
        place. You can learn more about the projects I built since then in the
        <a href="/projects">Projects section</a>, and find out how to support my
        work on the <a href="/support-me">Support Me</a>
         page.
