      <h1>Welcome to my <strike>Twisted Mind</strike> Professional Website</h1>
      <p>
        Since 2019, <strong
          >I've been building projects and communities that make the web a
          better, more joyous place.</strong
        > To this end, I've added marketing, business and many other skills to
        my software engineering background. I also introduced a diverse array of
        internet dwellers to open source development, and in many cases to
        programming itself.
      </p>

        You can learn more about the projects I built in the
        <a href="/projects">Projects section</a>, and find out how to support my
        work on the <a href="/support-me">Support me</a>
         page.
