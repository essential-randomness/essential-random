      <h2>Who I am & what I do</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          In 2020, I quit my job as a Silicon Valley software engineer to embark
          on a mission to bring the internet back to the place of joy and
          creativity I grew up in.
        </p>
        <p>The initiatives I launched and am currently leading include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            BobaBoard, a privacy-centric, open source, forum-like software for
            online communities
          </li>
          <li>
            Fandom Coders, a 200+ people community where expert and beginner
            coders in fandom meet for friendship, support and learning
          </li>
          <li>
            Random fun stuff, including RobinBoob (a &ldquo;ship-ownership
            certificates&rdquo; marketplace parodying the NFT craze), and
            FujoBoard (a reimagining of the old Yaoi paddles phenomenon for the
            modern fangirl)
          </li>
        </ul>
         I&apos;ve also introduced many people in fandom (often members of
        communities underrepresented in tech) to open source and web
        development, and I&apos;m actively working on related educational
        material.

        My well-thought-out roadmap towards a better internet cannot survive
        without a full-time person at its helm. With your contribution, you will
        become an active enabler of the movement I&apos;m spearheading, and will
        rest assured that someone out there is fighting the good fight (also) in
        your name.
